Organize, view and retrieve all of your pictures, music, videos, & documents; built-in app backup & task killer; manage all your files regardless of where they are stored (in a cloud or on another device such as):* Phone* Tablet* Clouds (Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook, Box & SkyDrive)* PC, Mac, Linux (via networking)Click here to ask to join our Beta Test Google + Group: http://plus.google.com/b/103095216021321867726/communities/106251776630475861309Ever try to find a file but can't remember where you put it?  ASTRO has the most robust technology to search phones or search for files in the mobile world, giving you the ability to do anything from broad searches across all locations mentioned above for types of content (pics, music, videos, etc.) to very specific file searches based on file name, size, location, etc.   And, with ASTRO's unique \"CLOUD HOPPING (TM)\", you can move files from one cloud to another in a single copy or move/paste - without having to download them first before sending to your destination cloud!  ASTRO now has support for Leef Bridge, a powerful, yet simple, innovative USB flash drive that allows users to easily transfer files to other devices (Android phones, tablets, Macs and PCs). Visit www.2leef.com/bridge for more information and a list of compatible devices.What are some of the benefits to ASTRO\u2019s new file Indexing functionality:-  After your first search, results are almost instantaneous across all indexed locations (mobile device, clouds, networked locations) -  If you are offline, you can still search for files that have been indexed.  -  Eliminates redundant network calls in ASTRO, making some file search operations faster.  -  Better file search, file browsing experience in areas with spotty or slow network coverage.  How does ASTRO\u2019s new Indexing functionality work?-  As you browse through directories on your device, clouds or networked locations, ASTRO begins indexing your files in the background in order to speed up future searches you perform.       -  It will also build your index whenever you do a search.  It will build the index for your internal and external sd cards very quickly (typically under 15-20 seconds).  Clouds or networked locations will take longer and also depends on the number of files in those locations.-  You can also choose to proactively index any of your other locations like clouds (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive) and networked locations by doing a search on those locations or by going to Settings, Search index and click Rebuild index.  Keep in mind if you choose to index a 500GB server you have at home, it may take a while.  :)      -  You can go to Settings, Set Default Search Locations to set your default locations.     -  You can go to Settings, Search index and clear your index at any time as well.  - SWIPE SCREEN RIGHT to get to Clouds, Network Locations or Saved Searches fast- SWIPE SCREEN LEFT to get to Tools (App Backup, Task Killer, SD Card Usage), Settings and HelpASTRO File & Cloud Manager FREE gives you the ability to kill tasks or processes that burn battery life (Task Killer Tool) and easily backup apps (App Backup Tool) in case you lose or change phones.FEATURES INCLUDE: file manager, phone download manager, content management, multiple cloud management / cloud storage manager with Facebook, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and SkyDrive, android file browser, file and/or app backup, app manager, image and text viewers, networking, Bluetooth, SFTP, Zip Files, download manager, thumbnails, search files, task manager, attachments, and more.Quick Start Guide, FAQ's and Documentation: http://support.metago.net.ASTRO supports 11 languages including:  English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Russian & Portuguese.

{"title": "Advanced Task Killer", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=ReChild", "rating": "4.465306758880615", "Description": " Advanced Task Killer is also known as ATK which is #1 task manage app. It is a tool to kill applications and boost memory. -Ignore List-One tap widget-Auto kill-Customize item heightATK is often used to kill app and clean memory. We do suggest people use ATK manually kill apps instead of auto killing app.1. How to use it (for new users to quick start)?ATK is pretty simple. Open this tool and take a look at the running applications list? Uncheck some apps you don't want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button 'Kill selected apps', it will kill all applications checked. 2. How to use it (for new users to do more)?If you don't want to kill any app, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it's checking box will turn to gray. 3. Why there are app running that I haven't used or even opened?Some app will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events. 4. What is ignore list/ignore?Ignore list is for you to ignore some app you don't want to kill. If you long press on the app listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select 'Ignore', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap 'Kill selected apps', it won't be killed any more. 5. What is default action for long press?You can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application (displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to 'Switch to'. 6. Why I lost my network connection after I tap 'kill selected apps'? This is because some apps related with network connection are killed, such as 'voicemail'. You can ignore it instead of killing it. 7. Why my Home reloaded?This is because some apps related with Home are killed. Such as 'HTC Sense', 'Mail'(if it is integrated with Home). You can ignore it instead of killing it. 8. Why I cannot receive notification of Email?This is because you killed 'Email'. Instead of killing it, you need to ignore it. 9. What is Auto Kill?If you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level- Safe: Only kill the apps aren't running but still consume memory.- Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren't running.- Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with.You should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like 'Auto-Kill: 12:20'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time. App killer is only a tool to kill apps and task. It won't help your battery directly. But if you kill any app which consumes battery a lot, you might think app killer is helping your battery.Advanced Task Killer Pro is paid version which doesn't contain ads.Note: For android 2.2 and later version, task manager cannot kill services and front apps, you have to force stop them. If you use task manager to kill them, services might restart; also notification won't be erased from the top bar. So we don't suggest people use task manager kill them.

And also supports Triple DES with key sizes of 168 and 112 bits.\u2022 When the data file is decrypted, up to all combinations of algorithm, key size and cipher mode of operation (CBC, CFB, OFB and ECB) are tried with the Master password to unlock the data file. This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\u2022 Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\u2022 The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\u2022 Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\u2022 Unlike other similar Android apps aWallet has no internet access permission (forever).

{"title": "Screen Grabber", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=The+Jared+Company", "rating": "3.974372148513794", "Description": " JaredCo delivers again with Screen Grabber \u2013 the totally flexible screen capture app that lets you share your screen shots with anyone. Simple. Easy. Useful. ** Send SMS Permission is needed to allow you to send the screenshot to a friend by SMS.  The app will never send an SMS without you **And FREE._______________________________INSTRUCTIONS : Take a screenshot on the Galaxy S4, S3, or Note 2 using a hand swipe:  1. Open Settings > Motion.  2. Scroll down and find Hand Motion, then Palm Swipe to Capture, and tick the box.  3. Close the menu and shape your hand like you are \u201cchopping\u201d the screen, set your hand on either side of the screen, then horizontally swipe across it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter which way. If you\u2019ve done it correctly, you should hear the camera shutter and receive a notification that a picture has been saved to the gallery.Another way to take a screenshot on the Galaxy S4, S3 or Note:  1. Pressing the Power and Home buttons at the same time will also grab an image of the screen. This can be awkward to get right, so it\u2019s important to remember to press both buttons at the same time, and hold them until the shutter sound is heard.Both these methods also work on the Samsung Galaxy Notes as well, and the second method is also applicable to the Galaxy S2.Take a screenshot on other Android 4.0, 4.1, or 4.2 devices:   1. Press the Power button and Volume down key at the same time. Remember to hold them until you hear a click or see a screenshot sound. This works on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and the Google Nexus 7 tablet and should be the first method you try on an Android device. Remember to hold both keys down at precisely the same time, and hold until the shutter clicks._______________________________With Screen Grabber, send a map or directions to your best friend with a couple of clicks. There\u2019s nothing quite like Screen Grabber and free is always good. Real good.\u2022\tWith a single click take a screen shot of your Android screen. Tap. Done.\u2022\tEmail that screen shot to anyone, anywhere, any time. JaredCo makes sharing simple.\u2022\tScreen Grabber stores all your screen captures in a new picture file called Screen Grabs. Want to see you contacts list from a month ago? Easy if you grabbed a screen shot of that important client\u2019s phone number. It\u2019s in the file labeled Screen Grabs, right where we put it for you.\u2022\tWant to send a map or directions to your technically-impaired friends? It doesn\u2019t get any easier than click and send with Screen Grabber.\u2022\tSo simple to synch, Screen Grabber does it all for you. Download and you\u2019re good to go.  Pictures, app icons, maps, tools, contacts, addresses \u2013 no matter what\u2019s showing up on your screen, Screen Grabber stores it in one place so you don\u2019t have to fumble for what you need now.And best of all, Screen Grabber is totally free so it costs you zip. But, like all JaredCo apps, it delivers real functionality that enhances your Android experience.You\u2019ve got nothing to lose and lots of utility to gain.

{"title": "Jelly Bean StatusBar", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Team+Syndicate", "rating": "2.9131150245666504", "Description": " Get the new Jelly Bean StatusBar on any Android device without waiting for an official 4.2 update!Jelly Bean StatusBar does not require root access or any special changes so it will work on all Android devices. It basically overlays the stock device status bar providing you with a custom, fully functional status bar of your choice! But what about your notifications? Don't worry, we have made all incoming notifications appear on the status bar as well so you will still be able to see your notifications! In order for Jelly Bean StatusBar to handle all third party notifications, you must give it permission through the Accessibility Manager. This must manually be done through the settings. Go to Settings > Accessibility >Jelly Bean StatusBar > ON, or contact us for quick support.What if you don't want to keep receiving notifications from certain applications? Well, Jelly Bean StatusBar also has a built in ignore list so you can exclude any application's notifications from occurring!What are the main features of Jelly Bean StatusBar?\u2605 Clones the official status bar from Android 4.2\u2605 Allows support for third party notifications\u2605 Auto-detection for hidden status bar or screen orientation\u2605 Task killer safe! Will auto-reboot when killed\u2605 Smooth gestures for default pull down\u2605 Settings to choose what content you want to display\u2605 Exclusion list for unwanted application notifications\u2605 Notification Counter for repeating notifications\u2605 0% battery drain (based on normal device use)\u2605 Low ram foot print of under 24mb\u2605 And so much more!\u2028Custom ROM and MIUI UsersJelly Bean StatusBar cannot support all of the ROM's available for Android, especially MIUI. Please be respectful of this application and know that this status bar may not work 100% on your ROM. If you find any problems with Jelly Bean Statusbar, please contact us and we will do our best to fix it!Need help? Contact us!Please remember to contact us if you have any questions or comments!!!! We cannot reply to comments on the market. There will be bugs on some devices as developers have to support many different Android devices and screen densities. Please do not post bad comments and ratings about a problem. We will be happy to work you through any issue you may have. Thank you!Other Information & permissionsWhy so many permissions needed!?!? Well, Jelly Bean StatusBar is a different kind of application. It is designed to constantly run and overlay your stock status bar. It has to receive third party notifications and access information about your device. Without this information, the statbar would not run correctly. Please accept these permissions as we are using each one properly and for a specific use!Avast reporting as malware!?! No, its not malware. It is the AdNetwork SDK. Avast and some other scanners will mark as a potential risk because of the required permissions. Don't be fooled, use Lookout security. Contact us for more info.This app will provide a few useful shortcuts on your device in the form of a search bookmark link and home screen icon. This gives us a few cents each time the app is downloaded for the first time and will help us out a lot in developing more apps. If you do not want to use these new tools, you can simply ignore or delete them by dragging the icon to the trashcan and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it).

Because\u2026* It\u2019s from RealVNC\u2122, the inventors of VNC remote access and control technology.* We\u2019ve 20 years\u2019 experience making the remote control experience as good as it gets.* There\u2019s no limit to the number of computers you can access, nor how long you can connect in for.* We support the widest range of platforms in the business: www.realvnc.com/products/vnc/tech-specs/#platforms* It\u2019s free to use whether you\u2019re connecting locally or over the Internet (and you won\u2019t see an advert, either).Don\u2019t believe us? Check out our reviews! Then check out the hidden costs of other remote access solutions\u2026===Getting connected===We recommend you try this out at home or in the office first:1) Make sure your computer and Android device are connected to the same Wi-Fi-enabled local network.2) Install this app.3) Download VNC 5 to your computer and apply a Free license, or take a 30 day trial of our premium security and performance features.4) Connect!When you\u2019re ready to go out and about:5) Make sure both computer and Android device are connected to the Internet (for example over 3G, or from a Wi-Fi hotspot).6) Configure the computer\u2019s firewall to enable VNC.7) Configure the computer\u2019s router to forward port 5900.For more information on steps 6 and 7, see www.realvnc.com/products/vnc/documentation/latest/getting-connected/===Security and privacy===When you connect, you\u2019re asked for credentials (this is to protect your computers if you share or lose your Android device). We\u2019re often asked what these are:* If you applied a Free license to VNC 5, enter the password you created when you installed it on your computer.* If you applied a paid-for license (or took a trial), enter the username and password you normally use to *log on* to your computerWe don\u2019t want to hide anything from you, so please note that connections will only be secure (encrypted) if you applied a paid-for license to VNC 5 (or took a trial). Connections to a Free license are fast and responsive, but we hope you\u2019ll understand that end-to-end encryption is a premium feature.===How to control===Your finger moves the mouse cursor rather than clicking where you touch, as you might expect with a touchscreen. While this may seem counter-intuitive at first, you\u2019ll soon appreciate the fine-grained control it gives you of a high-resolution computer desktop (especially from the small screen of a phone!)Mouse operations are performed by gestures. So to double-click, position the mouse cursor appropriately and then tap the screen twice. To see which gestures we\u2019ve mapped to other click, drag, and scroll operations, tap [?] on the toolbar to open the help.To type, open the keyboard from the toolbar. Function and other special keys (such as Ctrl, Alt, Delete, and the Cmd key on a Mac) are available from a sliding bar above the keyboard.As for the rest: it\u2019s as though you\u2019re sitting in front of your computer!

Allows you to share your position via email, text message, twitter, etc, and displays your current GPS location in both decimal format and in sexagesimal (degrees minutes seconds) format.  Internet access is not required to send your location with a text message.  View your position on Google maps. It also displays the accuracy of your signal, and time since you last received a valid GPS signal.  Useful for when you just want a position fix or want to determine GPS dead spots.This description is auto translated Click to read the original English descriptionIf you like this application, you may be interested in the full version depending on your needs.If you are mainly interested in altitude, this newly released application may be better for you.*** Important! *** Common user mistakes:- This application uses satellite based GPS, so do not expect it to work well under a roof.  For best results, go outside away from any tall buildings where there is a good view of much of the sky.Please note that this application has not been tested on all phones (There are too many to test). You should test it on your device before you rely on it.Frequently asked questionsWhat is the difference between satellite and network based location?Satellite location is usually more precise and does not require a data connection.  However, it does not work well under a roof.Network location works well under a roof.  It requires a data connection and nearby WIFI networks.For best results with this application, we recommend that you enable both.Why are the coordinates sometimes orange?They are orange when the signal is coming from the network location provider.  This only happens when satellite is not available or the network location provider is more accurate.Which datum does it use?WGS 84Why does the user have to select their language?Because the translation is not great. Many non-native English speakers prefer to use English for this app.  Otherwise, they would have to change their device language setting and that would change everything on their device.Why don't you translate the app professionally?It is a lot of work.  Also, every update would require talking to (and paying) 40 translators.  This is a very simple app that should be useable even with poor translations.Update HistoryMarch 4, 2014version 1.66- now also uses network location when satellite is not available. March 3, 2014version 1.64- updated to Android 4 (unfortunately, this makes the application about 25% larger)- added 3 more languages- small bug fixesDecember 4, 2013version 1.62- Error catch to prevent devices without a GPS receiver from crashing.  Some manufactures incorrectly include satellite GPS capability in the device manifest.- Removed an ad libraryAugust 2013version 1.61- Better scaling for different displays..- Option to keep GPS going in the background for X minutes when you exit via the home key.  It takes significantly longer to acquire the first position than subsequent positions.  Default time is 1 minute.

IMPORTANT: You need Text-To-Speech engine and voices installed on your device to use this app. If you don't have it yet, pickup from Play Store Acapela, Ivona or SVOX TTS package. You may use more than one if you want.Features:* Click \"Share\" or \"Send by Email\" button/menu item in any app to send text to @Voice Aloud Reader for aloud reading over speakers or a headset.* If \"Share\" is not available, copy text in another app and paste it into @Voice for aloud reading.* Option to instantly read aloud text copied to clipboard.* Open text, PDF, DOC, DOCX, RTF, OpenOffice documents or HTML files from Android file system for reading aloud.* Easily add saved Pocket articles to @Voice reading list - in Read List screen, press Menu - Add articles from Pocket* Save articles opened in @Voice to files for later listening. Construct listening lists of many articles for uninterrupted listening one after the other. Order the list as needed, e.g. more important articles first.* Dropbox sync! Enable, then build your list on one device, e.g. a tablet, then listen on your phone. Or from your computer, use File/Save As - \"HTML only\" function in the browser, save to @Voice Dropbox folder, then listen on your phone.* Easily control speech generator volume, pitch and rate of speech.* Pause/resume speech as needed with wired or Bluetooth headset buttons, plus click Next/Previous buttons to jump by sentence, long-click the same buttons to switch to the next/previous article on a list.* Can automatically recognize the language of an article and use appropriate TTS voice, if available, or set your preferred voices manually with \"Select language\" menu item.* Options for additional pause between paragraph, start talking as soon as a new article is loaded or wait for a button press, start/stop talking when wired headset plug is inserted/removed.* Optional sleep timer to stop speech after a given timeout.ABOUT PERMISSIONS:The full Internet access is needed because the \u201cShare\u201d function from web browsers and any news reading apps I tried, sends us only the URL address (http://something...). They do not send the full text of articles, so @Voice has to download the article from the Internet to be able to read it aloud or save for later reading. Only by using Copy text function in one app, and pasting it in @Voice, or by saving the full text in one app to storage and opening a file in @Voice, you could avoid Internet connection, but this is not very convenient. Also - the new Dropbox sync function needs Internet access, of course. There is no way to avoid it.Tags: TTS, Text to Speech, read aloud, speak aloud, PDF, PDF read aloud, Talking, Type to Speak, Type and Say, Document Reader, Webpage Reader, reader, Type to Talk, speach, txt, \"Text to Speech\", voice, reading, text to voice, read to me  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperionics.avar", "price": "0", "date_published": "September 20, 2014", "email": "atVoice@hyperionics.com", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "category": "Productivity", "developer": "Hyperionics Technology LLC", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "Varies with device", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.hyperionics.com/atVoice&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFxq0lOP46Q4WNq79GhxAScNuejcA", "reviewers": "7270"}

Your offline voice controlled personal assistant with a difference...What makes utter! different?utter! is not your average Siri clone and doesn\u2019t attempt to be a gimmick of a virtual assistant application, its priority is to be super functional and ultra fast! It allows many device based commands to be performed offline, without the need for a data connection (Jelly Bean only).utter! runs in the background of your device, is very lightweight on resource and does not have a user-interface, so its functions are available anywhere on the device, at any time, to interact with any application.With highly optimised algorithms, utter! aims to make voice control on your device, something you wonder how you ever did without! Something that is achieved faster than you could do it manually and an implementation that takes full advantage of the openness of the Android Platform, by giving you full device control in addition to using the functions in your favourite installed applications. There\u2019s no need to open up a separate application to execute your voice commands. With just a shake, wave, or a good old fashioned button press, utter! wakes to address you as you see fit, wherever you are on your device, whatever you are doing.. and it won\u2019t get in the way.So, please do get involved in the testing stage, give me your feedback and help me create a Voice Controlled Personal Assistant that is truly useful! One that makes fast offline voice recognition for Android a reality! Why so many permissions?utter! needs to do everything for you hands free, so you don't have to touch the device. Permissions such as automatically sending text messages and placing calls will be used under these circumstances.

I can\u2019t get the problem sorted! There\u2019s an email link in the application, I\u2019d be delighted to solve any bugs you find.

Due to its implementation as sync adapter it integrates seamlessly with the native calendar app and widgets and operates invisible in the background.Also, check out SmoothSync for Cloud Contacts to sync your iCloud contacts!Important note for Android 4.1 and Samsung users: To prevent the removal of your accounts on reboot install this app (before you install SmoothSync):https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.jb.workaround.icloudcalendarPlease note that there is a new issue in Android 4.4: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=66905It causes accounts to be removed when an app is updated. Installing the workaround app should help.Get support and news via email or via Twitter at https://twitter.com/SmoothSyncThe app is designed to be as user friendly as possible. So, just enter your account data, select your calendar and SmoothSync will keep your calendars in sync.This app will create new calendars on your device (one for each calendar in your iCloud account). It will not sync calendars of other account (like Google) to iCloud.Please, if you find a bug send me an email. Without detailed error description I often can't do anything especially when I can't reproduce it.Important! If your phone removes the accounts on reboot, move the App back from SD card to the phone. Some phones (if not all) can't handle sync adapters on SD Card properly.The last screen shot shows the calendar selection dialog of the event editor of the stock calendar app.Thanks to the guys at http://www.busymac.com/ for their support!!Features:* two-way-sync* supports multiple accounts* supports subscribed calendars* initial support for attachments (Android 4.1 or newer, doesn't work with all calendars apps)* supports reminders if this app is installed: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.tasks* multiple calendars per account* automatic calendar discovery* automatic sync of calendar colors and names* syncs multiple alarms* time zone support* customizable sync interval (default: 4h, local changes will be synced almost immediately)* synchronizes entire calendar* encrypts passwordsknown limitations:* no \"push\" support (yet)iCloud and Apple are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

However, it has found many users outside university, for instance businesspersons who use it for business notes and sales presentations or artists who use it to create sketches and drawings.Its major target devices are tablets with Android 3.0 or later (it is developed on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 with an S-pen, and an Asus Nexus 7, a Samsung Nexus 10, an Amazon Kindle Fire HD, and an Asus MeMO Pad with an Adonit Jot Pro and a Wacom Bamboo stylus). The basic functionality works on all devices with Android 3.0 or later, but some which are hardware-dependent such as pressure sensitivity might not.NOTE: There is a free trial version to test if the app is right for you. The free trial version is fully functional with the exception that the number of notebooks is constrained to two, with no more than eight pages per notebook.User feedback:We would love to hear from you, please send feedback and feature requests to us by email (devel [a] acadoid.com).

Pro features are included too. MAIN FEATURES\u2022 Securely stores your passwords, credit card information, e-banking credentials, web accounts and other custom data.\u2022 Synchronizes encrypted data with the Cloud: Dropbox or Google Drive.\u2022 There is a built in Editor for changing or creating new data Categories with custom icons.\u2022 Search within fields.\u2022 Contains no advertisements.\u2022 Supports backup and restore of the encrypted data file to the Android USB device.\u2022 Export of unencrypted data in CSV format to the USB device.\u2022 There is an Auto lock feature that can be preconfigured for a specific period of time. PRO FEATURES, included:\u2022 Password Generator\u2022 CSV Import SECURITY FEATURES\u2022 All data is encrypted, including Entry names, Category definitions and the data itself. Even the choice of Favorite Category is encrypted.\u2022 Encrypts data using AES and Blowfish algorithms with key sizes of 256, 192 and 128 bits. And also supports Triple DES with key sizes of 168 and 112 bits.\u2022 When the data file is decrypted, up to all combinations of algorithm, key size and cipher mode of operation (CBC, CFB, OFB and ECB) are tried with the Master password to unlock the data file. This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\u2022 Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\u2022 The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\u2022 Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.

Lightning is the only launcher with scripting support, allowing an incredible flexibility with the use of JavaScript.LLX is a vitamined version of LL, with the following additions:* Enhanced app drawer, with the ability to create folders, hide apps, change the style in all ways, view running apps, most frequently used, recently installed, direct shortcuts to kill or uninstall apps... and more !* Included lock screen management: select one of your Lightning desktop to be used as the lock screen.* Support for configuring up to 100 distinct desktops, with customizable label and icon, for the purpose of managing multiple independent setups (personal, professional, for kids, etc.)* Built-in configurable messaging notifications (highly customizable badge for sms, missed calls, unread gmails)* Full scripting support, thanks to the easy to use and well known JavaScript language* App killer available from everywhere: long tap on an icon, select kill, et voil\u00e0.* Built-in per desktop wallpaper, available in the app drawer too.Things to be aware of (please read this notice):- With its wide set of options and switches, Lightning is the most customizable launcher, albeit perhaps not the easiest to configure yet ! Agreed, as most powerful tools, Lightning has a learning curve. But isn't that a small price to pay to get the most exciting and unique home screen ;-) By default LL will start in normal mode although an expert option found in the general section will show even more settings. Join the community to get tips and tricks !- Problem setting LLX the default launcher ? Please install this free app : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.kunes.android.launcher.loader- LLX is a superset of LL and fully replace it: on first use it will import all data from LL, and LL can safely be uninstalled.

{"title": "Advanced Task Killer Pro", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=ReChild", "rating": "4.506165981292725", "Description": " Advanced Task Killer is also known as ATK. It is a tool to kill applications running. This version is pro version which doesn't contain ads.ATK is often used to kill apps and clean memory. We do suggest people use ATK manually kill apps instead of auto killing apps. -Ignore List-One tap widget-Auto kill-Customize item height1. How to use it (for new users to quick start)?It is pretty simple. Open this tool and take a look at the running applications list? Uncheck some apps you don't want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button 'Kill selected apps', it will kill all applications checked. 2. How to use it (for new users to do more)?If you don't want to kill any application, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it's checking box will turn to gray. 3. Why there are programs running that I haven't used or even opened?Some applications will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events. 4. What is ignore list/ignore?Ignore list is for you to ignore some applications you don't want to kill. If you long press on the application listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select 'Ignore', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap 'Kill selected apps', it won't be killed any more. 5. What is default action for long press?You can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application(displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to 'Switch to'. 6. Why I lost my network connection after I tap 'kill selected apps'? This is because some apps related with network connection are killed. Such as 'voicemail'. You can ignore it instead of killing it. 7. Why my Home reloaded?This is because some apps related with Home are killed. Such as 'HTC Sense', 'Mail'(if it is integrated with Home). You can ignore it instead of killing it. 8. Why I cannot receive notification of Email?This is because you killed 'Email'. Instead of killing it, you need to ignore it. 9. What is Auto Kill?If you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level- Safe: Only kill the apps aren't running but still consume memory.- Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren't running.- Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with.You should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like 'Auto-Kill: 12:20'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time. Note: For android 2.2 and later version, task manager cannot kill services and front apps, you have to force stop them. If you use task manager to kill them, services might restart, also notification won't be ereased from the top bar. So we don't suggest people use task manager kill them.

Note that a data connection is required for the map.- Email or text as many saved points as you wish. Kml files can be attached to emails.- Enter coordinates manually in either decimal or sexagesimal (degrees, minutes, seconds) format.- Notes field for each location.- List of coordinates is searchable by location name and notes.- Includes altitude.- No ads.- A radar-like readout that shows your locations with respect to your current location and bearing.  See the screen shot with the large grey circle.  This can be used with no data connection (unlike Maps).------------ distance units: kilometres, miles, and nautical miles. Altitude and signal accuracy are only displayed in meters.  For the metrically impaired, a meter is almost 1.1 yards.This description is auto translated Click to read the original English description<<<     Update information    >>>version 2.15August 5, 2014Added feet and yards unitsHopefully fixed a bug that occurs when entering coordinates manually.Added a folder picker to help with specifying an custom directory.  Set custom folder is no longer found under the settings tab.  When you go to save a file, the popup that appears where you name the file has a 'change folder' button.You can now copy and paste coordinates in decimal format to the clipboard like the free version.Network GPS location is used if satellite GPS is poor.  Note that network location is usually less accurate and does not report altitude.  If network location is used, the coordinates will be orange.  You can disable Network location is settings.version 2.04December 22, 2013 update includes:- export to .kml file (Sd card is needed).  You can also choose the folder.- import .kml files.- attach .kml to email file (can be done without an Sd card)- notes field for each location.- much more efficient list and map.- shows current location and compass on the map.  You can disable this.- custom name prefix. example: 'Fishing Trip'- auto-increment custom name. Example: Fishing Trip 001, Fishing Trip 002,  Fishing Trip 003- Automatic GPS enable and disable.  You can choose to keep GPS active for x minutes after you close the application.  The default is 1 minute.  Note that it takes significantly longer to acquire the first signal.  Also, the first few signals tend to be very inaccurate during the GPS 'warm up' period.- list is searchable by name and notes.  This includes 'fuzzy search', or 'approximate matching'.- Options for more map marker sizes and more color options.- Can disable the satellite view on the map to view roads only.  This loads much quicker on slow connections.- Includes altitude.  This was not trivial to implement accurately for offline use.  You can choose between WGS84 (ellipsoid) and EGM96 (approximate sea level).Known Limitations:- Coordinates in polar regions will not appear correctly on the map. The latitude range seems to be within -84 to +81.  All of the Antarctic coastline is covered. Northern Greenland is not covered. - The Compass on the maps page may error by as much as 20 degrees at times.  Note that electronics and iron interfere with the compass on your device.- .kmz files are not supported.  A .kmz file is simply a compressed .kml file.

It will also show notification quick action buttons if expansion is enabled.If the phone is in pocket, don't worry. Notific is intelligent enough to understand that and will not turn on the screen. But if you take out the phone from your pocket within 10secs (customizable) it will turn on the screen for you.Version 2.0 comes with a new Android Wear inspired theme (4.4+), in case you don't like the dark HOLO style.Notific doesn't impact battery life as it will only use the proximity sensor for 10 secs.The memory usage is highly optimized (2-10MB) and doesn't use 50MB+ as in other notification apps.The multitude of notifications we get every day are probably the most sensitive information for some and these deserve the utmost privacy.That's why Notific comes with absolutely no private data mining. No crash data, No Google analytics collection.It doesn't require connecting to Internet, so you can be sure that there's no way your information goes out of your device.From v2.4 onwards, you can use privacy mode feature to keep your notification content safe from prying eyes.The app is in active development and will get frequent updates and lots of features are in pipeline.Proximity sensor values are calibrated for Nexus devices by default. If you have problems with the sensor on Galaxy or Xperia devices, try calibrating the sensor from app settings or TurnOff Pocket ModeThe app currently is incompatible with some custom lockscreen apps like WidgetLocker or EverythingMe launcher.Before you buy it's recommended to test with trial version from here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2804624Wallpaper credits : Asher Simonds, on Cyanogenmod 11 ROM  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anandbibek.notifypro", "price": "EGP7.01", "date_published": "September 17, 2014", "email": "ananda.bibek@gmail.com", "downloads": "5,000 - 10,000", "category": "Productivity", "developer": "Anand Bibek", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "Varies with device", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t%3D2804624&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFXYHDPFQZqP40v0UlbrP82B8cVmQ", "reviewers": "579"}

For various credit cards, online-banking, security-token, email accounts and so on? iPIN - and your PINs and passwords are always at hand. Your professional password manager on the go and at home: access at lightning speed, as secure as possible and also in sync via WiFi Sync at any time with your Android, Windows, Mac and iOS devices. The highlight: login with the sensor keyboard With an innovative sensor keyboard you'll have quick access to all your PINs - without any annoying and time-killing passwords. Just remember a geometrical shape, a digit, an alphabetic character or an individual sensor combination and set up your private sensor code. You can simply touch a sensor or swipe across multiple sensors at once. Naturally, combinations are allowed and should be used to make your sensor code as secure as possible. The first touch activates the sensor, and with a second touch the sensor becomes deactivated. You can activate and deactivate the sensors as often as you like. Your individual sensor code is calculated by the order in which you have activated and deactivated the sensors and in which way the sensors have been activated and deactivated: single touch or swipe. Security Security is of greatest importance! All data (including the data in iCloud if you enable iCloud synchronisation in iPIN) is encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard and a key length of 256 bit (abbreviated AES-256). With this state-of-the-art encryption algorithm your private data is protected from unauthorized access - even in the case your device gets into the wrong hands. KISS - keep it simple and secure iPIN tries to fulfill the KISS principle. iPIN was developed to store and display PINs and passwords - no more and no less. So the focus is on simplicity, clarity and high level of security.

It will be started whenever you try to edit or create a contact (and you select \"Contact Editor Pro\").This app will not edit or remove contacts from read-only sources like Facebook! This is due to the definition of read-only ;-).Also, if you see a blank screen when editing contacts that are aggregated with a Facebook contact, try to remove and recreate your Facebook account. Facebook limits access from other apps which breaks the contacts API in a way. For further information see http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/22/google-android-facebook-contacts/Please keep in mind that your sync adapter may not be able to sync all fields that Contact Editor Pro offers.Also, this app lets you edit some fields, that many contact apps do not even show (department, role, website labels). This is not a Contact Editor Pro bug.Note regarding Events:There is a big problem with events in this editor (better: with Android). The Android SDK documentation states about the database column for the date: 'The event start date as the user entered it.'  Unfortunately does every manufacturer have it's own opinion about the format. Some are happy with 'yyyy-mm-dd', my phone uses unix timestamps.So, before you can edit an event's date you will have to set the device's internal date format. Open the menu and select \"settings\". If your device doesn't recognize one format, try another one. Write me if no format works for you!Btw: just writing a comment like \"Doesn't work on...\" won't help neither you nor me to get it running on your device. Please contact me if you have problems.Please report bugs by sending me a mail stating what happened and what you did before it happened.

It is a simple app to manage default apps for different types of actions that Android does.  This app allows to you to manage for almost all the common actions.It eliminates all the hassles and troubles of remembering defaults set for various applications such as Audio, Video, E-mail, SMS, etc. It is very handy for active Android lovers who use a wide range of apps and keep changing them from the default Android settings.FAQs:Q: Why DAM Pro?A: As millions of apps are appending to the Android Market each month offering multiple options for a particular category such as Music, Video, etc., we are forced to cherry-pick a default app for a particular category while performing some action. We know how to set the default, but we are pestered while clearing/resetting the set default. None of the App Managers or Task Managers on the Android Market targeted this issue. So, DAM is an exclusive & innovative app that eliminates the hassle of setting/clearing defaults, & Uninstalling any app from DAM itself.Q: What is the difference between the Lite and Pro versions?A:  Most notably, it\u2019s an AD-FREE (Donate) Version. It has an inbuilt Uninstaller as some customers as per some user requests. We are relentlessly refining our UI to provide finest experience. Plus it requires no special permissions to run the app.Core features of DAM Pro are:* Ad-Free version with the Improved UIDisplays a list of different categories and the default app selected for each one of them* Wide range of categories consists of Audio, Audio Streaming, Browser, Email, Home Launcher,Messaging, PDF files, Phone Dialer, Video and Video Streaming* Exhibit a list of applications that can be used for a particular type of category* Clear defaults of a particular category without remembering the set default or without cruising all theway into the Android default settings screen* Reduces atleast 4 user clicks and saves the time to search the app with default set* Allows you to set default for any category from the application itself.* Does not require any permission at all !* Built in uninstallerPLEASE READ THE BELOW INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING:1. To set the default application, please check the 'USE BY DEFAULT ICON' and only then select the application. Otherwise, the application WILL NOT BE set as the default one.2. Once the default app is SET, the application will open. It might however open with some error-message like 'FILE CANNOT BE OPENED' or 'ERROR WHILE OPENING FILE'. Don't worry, the application is SET as default successfully.

Each day you report on whether you succeeded yesterday, building up streaks of habits and ingraining the activities into your life.\"After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain\" (Jerry Seinfeld)Habit Streak has two key advances on Jerry Seinfeld's original technique. Firstly it allows you to build several chains up at once. Secondly it (optionally) prompts you every day to report on your success (whereas one could easily forget to update or look at a physical calendar).\u2713 New in Pro version.The Pro version has rebuilt several elements of the application from the ground up to enable new features.It includes import (from either Habit Streak or Habit Streak Pro).It features improved layouts (and a reduced install size).The correction mode is now much more powerful, giving you a fine level of control over habits (particularly useful if you are moving from another habit tracking system and want to import your progress so far).The habit view features a new past streak graph (once you enough past streaks for this to be useful, if you have a small number of recorded streaks then the graph does not appear).There are two widgets. One shows you if you are up to date (and if so your streak count and total), if not it prompts you to update (telling you when you last updated for). The other shows your best and worst streaks. Tap on either to open the App.Add to calendar: now (on supported devices) you can add reminders to your calendar both for individual habits and reminders to update Habit Streak. To add individual reminders hold down on a habit.NB Nothing is added to your calendar unless you specifically request it. You must have a default calendar set up on your device for this to work (you need an Android 4.0 or newer device).\u2713  Cloud BackupAutomatic backup to Dropbox: you can link the App to Dropbox and it will automatically backup your data in a standard format (it is not on my server or restricted to this App).\u2713 New 2014 Android 4.0+ RedesignHabit Streak Pro was recently redesigned for Android 4.0+ (the vast majority of Android devices). On Android 4.0+ you can now access common actions with a swipe to the left and see a quick overview screen or guide with a swipe to the right. There are also many visual and functional updates.On older devices you can still use Habit Streak Pro; however, a small number of features will not be available (and it may not look quite as pretty).\u2713 Reviews from the free version: \"Fantastic. Easy to use, and I'm finding it effective for taking on multiple new habits.\"Chriswaterguy\"This simple app has altered the course of my life. Thank you!\"Frank\"Love this application. It has helped me create many new habits. The sister application Task Life is great as well.\"Diane\u2713 If you want To Do list-like functionality see my other app \"ToDo Log\" which allows for real time recording, repeated and one-off events along with graphs of your past performance. For less than daily tasks check out \"Task:Life\", for a different approach, based around the idea of what proportion of days you do something.

Chose actions that should fire when tag is scanned.Please note that your screen will have to be on for the phone to be able to scan NFC-tags. This is a limit in the Android system and can not, at the moment, be changed.Please also note that at the moment the plugin can't detect when you remove your phone from a tag.The plugin reads the Unique Identifier of a NFC-enabled tag. This means that you will not need to write any data to the tag. Instead you can use any NFC-enabled card. Such as commuter cards, access card or whatever you have lying around. These cards can then be linked to trigger any other setting or action that is available from within Locale or Tasker.One user scenario can be that you place a NFC-tag in your car. Once the tag is scanned it could enable bluetooth and start the navigation app of your choice.It supports the following standards: Sony SmartTags, MifareClassic, MifareUltralight, ISO14443-4, ISO14443-3A, ISO14443-3B, JIS6319-4, ISO15693.If you have conflicts with other NFC-applications such as the default Tags-app you can do the following:If you have a Ice Cream Sandwich phone - System Settings->Apps->ALL->Tags->DisableIf you have a Gingerbread phone you will have to write a unique tag for this plugin. To do this follow this guide http://goo.gl/uZmYvIf you have trouble finding the plugin in Tasker, this is where you should find it.

This might be due to wakelock holding apps. \u201dWakelock Detector\u201d helps you to detect battery draining apps in your Android phone by checking wakelock usage history. Now you can easily find out what keep your phone awake and drain your battery when it is idle! \u201cWakelock\u201d is a mechanism of power management service in Android OS, which can be used to keep CPU awake (Partial wakelock) and keep the screen on(Full wakelock). Applications which use wakelock privilege improperly leads to situations where the CPU or phone screen stays active without user's knowledge  and thus causing dramatic battery drain.\u201cWakelock Detector\u201d shows wakelock usage statistics for all applications, which ever held wakelock since boot. By default it displays CPU wakelocks sorting by the longest usage time. Further, you can choose Screen wakelock type to see screen related wakelocks. For instance, if your screen is keeping on even after screen timeout or your screen turns on randomly by itself, then you can choose Screen wakelock type on the top (Brightness icon) to see which apps are using  screen wakelock. Furthermore, if you are interested in currently running applications then you can change sorting type to \"Active\" which shows active running applications on the top. For further details please refer to FAQ inside Settings.Main features:# shows both CPU wakelock (Partial wakelock) and  Screen(Full wakelock) ;# merges wakelocks of corresponding app into one expandable view for better user experience;# currently active running applications are shown in red color;# allows easy sorting options by Running state , Wakelock time and  Alphabetical order;How to use:#1 Charge your phone above 90% and unplug cable (or just reboot the phone)#2 Give it a time (1-2 hours) to accumulate some wakelock usage statistics#3 Open \u201cWakelock Detector\u201d#4 Check the apps on the top, if they show very long wakelock usage time then you found the cause of your battery drain!#NoticeWe are working on improving the performance of the \u201cWakelock Detector\u201d by adding new features regarding wakelock issues users usually face.

PostEver provides you the best solution to capture ideas or take notes on your Android while on the move.Once you have set up an Evernote account, capturing and forwarding your important ideas is as simple as tapping the PostEver \"Input Box\" and \"Send Button\". Send any portion of your notes; PostEver makes it simple to select and post just the information you want.You don't need to worry whether you have a network connection or not as PostEver allows you to type and send notes without a network connection, as many times as you need. Data you input will be saved and later sent in sequence when you connect to a network.PostEver is the only app that creates and saves a 'notebook' using the notes you took during the day rather than by using the individual text sent. The notebook stores the date in the file name, making accessing your notes more intuitive and increasing manageability. PostEver intentionally removes the management features for tag, notebook and note title; when traveling time can be spent focused on capturing ideas rather than on managing data. This way, the mind can be kept clear and energy can be spent on the generation of new ideas, relieving stress as well as increasing productivity.Note taking is only effective if you can easily recall your thoughts at a later date. Most of us memorize things in chronological order - PostEver organizes your notes the same way so as to match your natural memory retention and more easily jog your memory.In addition, Evernote features a powerful search function.We believe this application will benefit people from all walks of life, including: authors, writers, musicians, poets, entrepreneurs, producers, business people, housewives and students, its application is far reaching, stretching from creative activities to simple shopping notes.If you need additional functionality added to PostEver, it can be combined with many other applications both official and third party!

It has no use if you don't install MCW first.If you haven't done it yet, download it for free from http://goo.gl/EqZRah.If you are already a MCW user please make sure you have updated it to the latest version, as this extension only works with MCW version 1.6.0 and later (version 1.1.0 needs MCW v1.6.2).VERSION 1.1.1 This version fixes a couple of bugs, you should upgrade if:- your timezone uses DST (Daylight Time Savings)- you want to change color events sometimes, so they're different from the default calendar color (changed for consistency with other calendar apps)IMPORTANT NOTEThis extension is meant to provide an easy way to manage calendar events for users of Month Calendar Widget. It's not meant to be a full-fledged calendar app. The app aims for the same that MCW: do just one thing, with simplicity and beauty in mind.MAKING THE EXTENSION WORKJust download this app and provided you have MCW 1.6.2 or later installed, you will see your MCW widgets updated with marks signaling the dates which have events in your device calendar.If you don't see any marks, it's most probably because the calendar(s) are not visible on your device. There's a new setting for visibility in 1.1.0, tap the extension entry in MCW Settings to show Calendar Events' own Settings screen.USAGE:- Tap a date with a mark in MCW and the events will be listed inside the widget- Tap a date without a mark, you will see an empty list of events and from there you will be able to add a new event- From the events list, tap the plus sign to add an event for the date (will open the new event screen of your default calendar app)- Tap an event in the list to view its detail. From there you can edit or delete the event- Tap the back button to return to the calendar viewPERMISSIONS- READ CALENDAR: this is obviously needed!- WRITE CALENDAR: this was added in 1.1.0, only to be able to change the visible property of calendarsFEEDBACKIf you have problems installing/using this extension, have found a bug or just want to make a feature suggestion, drop me an e-mail.

It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on! There are over 30 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates. The app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. Supported elements include: * Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources * Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors * Manual SPST/SPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays * Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs * Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs * ADCs, and DACs * Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR * JK and D Flip-flops * 37 7400 series digital parts * 7-segment display and driver No matter your profession, we're sure you'll be amazed by iCircuit!

The 'next' button (button 0) in predict mode becomes the 'Add word' button in abc mode, for easily adding new words to the dictionary.3.) It learns your word prediction order as you type, so if the suggestions aren't right at first, it should improve as you type. 4.) If a word is not being suggested first, try typing it a few times in a row (without picking the wrong suggestion each time :-) ).If you have any trouble, please email. I'm excited to help!

Also, tapping a message in EA will open it in the corresponding app.  If you don\u2019t want to use one of the supported email clients, then you can use EA\u2019s free POP/IMAP add-on to fetch your messages from your mail server (EA will install it for you if you decide to use it).Supported Exchange clients:  TouchDown by NitroDesk and Enhanced Email by Quantum SolutionsIf you want to preview Exchange email in EA, your best options are to use either TouchDown or Enhanced Email.  TouchDown is a dedicated Exchange app that gives you access to your corporate email, calendar and tasks. Enhanced Email is a general email client that supports Exchange accounts in addition to POP/IMAP accounts.  Some people are also able to access their Exchange accounts using K9 or Kaiten.

Manages Events, Tasks, Memos and Contacts.There is a matching desktop PIM application for Windows-based PC's and data can be synced back and forth with Pimlico's DirectSync, as well as through Google Calendar see Pimlico Website at www.PimlicoSoftware.com.In addition to providing all the conventional calendar functionality, Pimlical has a wealth of features for the power user not present in any other calendar application on any platform. If you are looking for a \"cute\" and \"pretty\" calendar, you should look elsewhere, as this program is designed for users who need not only vastly more functionality in a calendar application, but also far more preference settings so it can be truly customized for their use. The relatively few negative reviews of this application are typically posted by users who were just looking for something that was pretty rather than super-functional (and of course it takes some study to even begin to learn all the things that it can do).Features include    * Quick Entry Templates    * Down-counting Reminders    * Floating Events, as well as tasks    * Custom icons, fonts and colors    * Full repeat support including irregular repeats    * Filters to control all aspects of event display    * Multiple calendar, category and group support    * Automatic backup, iCalendar Import/Export    * Link events to contacts, find all events linked to contact    * Undelete    * Voice entry of appts and optional, spoken alarms    * List of upcoming alarms shows all future alarms that are scheduled    * Daily Journal: automatic date/time stamping    * On-line manual    * Locates and Displays all separate instances of a repeat, including irregular repeats    * Snooze and Alarm management (snooze to start/end of appt as well as from now)    * Day, Day+, Week, Week+, Month, Month+ and List Views    * Dynamic resizing of font display with up/down strokes    * 450+ Preference Settings control all display aspects    * Fast entry of dates and times, 2 Date Pickers, 3 Time Pickers to choose from    * Full Timezone handling    * Advanced Find function    * iCalendar import and export    * Full local contacts support including vCard Import/Export    * Full local memo support using standard text files    * Events, tasks, contacts and memos all sync to matching Desktop application    * Separate widget available shows upcoming events, alarms, free time with a dynamic, resizable display and full control via P/A Filter to determine which events are shown in the widget.    * Supports both native Android calendar and secure (bypassing Cloud) local calendar on SD card that can sync to desktop version via DirectSync    * An active forum on Yahoo Groups populated with other Power Users interested in advancing the functionality of this application. Pimlical/Android is definitely a PIM for power users and not for the occasional-use novice. The focus of the application is directed towards efficiency and functionality, and for the author, CESD, this is a continual work-in-progress as new functionality is added on a regular basis.If you encounter issues on installing Pimlical/Android, first check out the FAQ\u2019s on the TechSupport tab of www.pimlicosoftware.com or go to the support forum at: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/PimlicalBest of all, all the profits go to the benefit of Wildlife Conservation, as CESD also manages the only private AZA-certified facility in the world for Gorillas (yes, gorillas! \u2013 see www.dewarwildlife.org).

No more need to draw a sketch of your apartment or furniture. Simply take a photo and annotate it with the dimensions on your phone or pad.ImageMeter has the broadest support for Bluetooth laser distance measurement devices. All devices from Leica, CEM, and Hilti are supported (see below for full list of devices).What is also special about ImageMeter is that it enables you to measure within the image long after you took the photo. It often happens that after taking the image, being back at home or in the office, one realizes that some important distances have not been measured. This is no problem anymore with ImageMeter, because it enables you to measure the missing lengths directly from the images, afterwards. Additionally, with this feature, you can also easily measure at places which are too difficult to reach. This works whenever the objects you want to measure are within a plane (even if it is only virtual) and if you can provide a reference rectangle for ImageMeter. ImageMeter will take care of all perspective foreshortening and still measure correctly. You can also have as many measurement planes in one image as you like.Features:- measurements of lengths, angle, and arbitrarily shaped areas- metric and imperial units (even formats like 1' 2 3/4\" are supported)- value input with autocompletion- text annotation with user definable preset texts and automatic text formatting- export to PNG and JPEG- sort your images into subfolders and export complete folders as ZIP archives- Bluetooth connectivity to laser distance meters for measuring lengths, areas, and angles.Supported bluetooth laser distance meters:- Leica Disto D110, D810, D510 (lengths only, Android 4.3 with Bluetooth LE required),- Leica Disto D3a-BT, D8, A6,- Hilti PD-38  (this is the only app that supports this device),- CEM iLDM-150.----------------------------------------------------This is the pro-version of ImageMeter, with:- unlimited number of annotations- no watermarks in your exported images.- unlimited bluetooth measurements----------------------------------------------------Documentation is available online at:http://dirk-farin.net/projects/ImageMeter/manual.htmlSupport email: imagemeter@gmail.com.Feel free to contact me if you observe any problems,or just want to give feedback.

{"title": "LectureVideos", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Acadoid+Developer", "rating": "4.463414669036865", "Description": " LectureVideos is a screencast extension to LectureNotes for video and audio recording while taking handwritten notes using LectureNotes.It has been designed while having a user at university (or at school) in mind, for instance a lecturer who is using it for producing tutorial videos or for recording her/his lecture while teaching using LectureNotes (by writing on the device and projecting the screen content for the audience) or a student who is using it to prepare tutorial videos for fellow students. However, it has many potential applications outside university, for instance in business or technology.Its major target devices are tablets with Android 4.1 or later (it is developed on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, an Asus Nexus 7, and a Samsung Nexus 10).NOTE: LectureVideos cannot be used on its own, it is designed to serve as an extension for LectureNotes and can only be used in conjunction with it. If you wish to record video and audio while taking handwritten notes, launch LectureNotes and start video and audio recording there, the video and audio files will be stored within the corresponding notebook directory.LectureVideos uses the Android MediaCodec API that became available with Android Jelly Bean to encode video and audio, so that Android 4.1 or later is required. It has been carefully tested on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, an Asus Nexus 7, and a Samsung Nexus 10. However, since the behaviors of the Android MediaCodec differ significantly between devices, LectureVideos might not work on a given device.LectureVideos entirely relies on the Android MediaCodec and does neither contain any codecs nor any other encoding, decoding, multiplexing, or demultiplexing code (mainly to avoid legal problems). The Android MediaCodec APIs of Android 4.1 and 4.2 do not provide a multiplexer to create a container format such as MP4, AVI, or MKV. Therefore, LectureVideos produces two files per session, an H264 file containing the encoded video signal and a 3GP file containing the encoded audio signal.On devices running Android 4.1 and 4.2, you need an external tool to multiplex the video and audio signals into a container format such as MP4, AVI, or MKV. There are a very large number of tools available on all OS to do that (for instance FFmpeg), and users dealing with video production are very likely to have such tool available anyhow.On devices running Android 4.3 and 4.4, you can still use an external tool to multiplex the video and audio signals into a container format (which can be advisable if you have specific optimization needs, for instance for streaming); furthermore, you can share the video as an MP4 container file in LectureNotes, and LectureVideos uses the Android MediaCodec API to multiplex the video and audio signals into the MP4 container format prior to sharing.User feedback:We would love to hear from you, please send feedback and feature requests to us by email (devel [a] acadoid.com). If you encounter a problem with the app, please email us and we will do our very best to fix it quickly.Major features:* requires only minimal permissions and no internet connection (we do respect your privacy!)* allows display content and audio signals to be recorded while taking handwritten notes using LectureNotes (root permissions not required)* allows recorded display content and audio signals to be replayed using LectureNotes* allows recorded display content and audio signals to be multiplexed into an MP4 container file using LectureNotes (Android 4.3 and 4.4 devices only)Possible issue: For good audio quality, it is advisable to use an external microphone, in particular when taking notes with a stylus with a hard tip in parallel (the noise that the tip causes on the device display and human voices are in the same frequency range and the former cannot be filtered away reliably).

Storyboard Studio offers a dedicated workflow to let you bring your scenes to life, one at a time, in a quick and efficient way. It offers tools for both artists and non-artists. Here is a list of the features:Dedicated Workflow \u2013 Storyboard Studio is strictly designed for storyboarding. This gives you all the tools you need to help you create scenes fast and efficiently.Artistic Tools \u2013 Storyboard Studio offers eight realistic brushes, including a felt marker, a ballpoint pen, a pencil, a paint brush, a highlighter, a charcoal pencil, an air brush, and an eraser. These brushes are easy to use and ready to go. No need to mess around with settings. These brushes will suit any artist\u2019s needs.Layer Support \u2013 This allows you to create multiple layered scenes and keep the foreground and background elements separate. There is no restriction on how many layers you can have.Cutouts \u2013 Storyboard Studio offers a variety of different posed people (actors) and directional arrows which you can place in your scene. This lets you bring your scenes to life quicker and easier. These cutout images are an excellent way for non-artists to capture the emotion and action of a scene without having to draw it out.Image Importing \u2013 Along with cutouts, you can also add your own images from your gallery, your camera, or from the web (powered by Google Image Search and Inspire Stream). Notes \u2013 You can attach text notes to each scene. These will be saved to your project and can be exported when you save your storyboard as an image.Multiple Forms of Exporting \u2013 Whether you want to create a storyboard, a scene list, a horizontal strip, a vertical strip, or export all your scenes to Photoshop. Storyboard Studio gives you multiple options, allowing you to customize how you want your storyboard to look when you export your scenes as an image. These formats include JPEG, PNG, and PSD.Slideshow \u2013 This mode lets you navigate through your scenes like a slideshow and is an excellent way to get a feeling of how the story plays out. It is also an excellent way to show your story to a colleague or friend.Aspect Ratio \u2013 You can define what aspect ratio you want your frames to be in. There are five types: Standard (4:3), Standard HD (16:9), Theatrical (1.85:1), Theatrical Widescreen (2.39:1), and the device's screen size. This gives you the ability to see how your scenes will look on the big screen.Clipboard \u2013 Cutout elements from a scene and save them to a clipboard for later use or to share between your projects.

Using SmartHeadset you can remap the buttons of your Bluetooth headset to do more useful things - like controlling a media player, telling you the time or starting a voice assistant!

While many handwriting recognition tools for smartphones and tablets leave users frustrated with the app\u2019s inability to correctly interpret their handwriting, WritePad\u2019s state-of-the-art handwriting recognition software will adapt and learn the user\u2019s style of writing.Key WritePad features:  -           Advanced multilingual handwriting recognition engine supports 11 languages, including Danish, Dutch, English (UK and US), Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Swedish, and Spanish.  -           Integration with any application allowing text input, such as email, SMS, notes, word processing, and others.  -           Statistical analyzer, which improves overall handwriting recognition quality by addressing common recognition errors. If this feature is enabled, WritePad will learn the user\u2019s own handwriting style.  -           Customizable auto-corrector, which automatically fixes common spelling and recognition errors.  -           Editable user dictionary to improve recognition of custom words and names not included in the main dictionary.  -           Built-in full keyboard with autocomplete; if needed, users can switch between keyboard and handwriting with a single touch of a button.  -           Four basic recognition modes: cursive/mixed or print for general text entry; Numeric for entering numbers and phone numbers; and Internet for entering email addresses and URLs.  -           Built-in calculator, enabling users to write simple equations such as \"22.3+15.66=\" and WritePad will calculate the result.  -           Letter shape selector allows users to further improve recognition quality by disabling unused letter shapes.WritePad Handwriting Recognition Tutorial:http://www.phatware.com/doc/WritePadTutorialAndroid.pdfWritePad User's Guide:http://www.phatware.com/doc/WritePad_Android.pdf  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phatware.writepad", "price": "EGP70.00", "date_published": "August 22, 2014", "email": "support-2@phatware.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "category": "Productivity", "developer": "PhatWare Corp.", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.3 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.phatware.com/android&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHM3s314g71EtARHts6g0a222BiYw", "reviewers": "295"}

This data can be used in SolarMeter  app for solar energy calculations.It has following important and  distinctive features:- measure in any selected plane in 3D space- Length, Angle, Area, Circle Modes- add/delete  any number of measurement/ruler lines- values assigned to each ruler line- measure objects in different directions- save and share you measurement - find object ratios, if you don't not need absolute measurements- compare object parts to each other- use custom and predefined reference objects- automatic reference object fine alignment using image processing- reset reference object alignment by LONG TOUCH on auto alignment button Partometer3D uses a phone/tablet camera and any available object with known size as a reference to perform measurement. To define the measurement plane a rectangular object  (sheet of paper, credit card, custom object) is used. Image processing is used for automatic fine alignment with the reference object.The App shows measurement results in different units: meters, millimeters, centimeters, feet, inches based on user settings. It also calculate dimensions of the object in relative units with respect to  the reference object (ROL).  There is an option to make a picture and work with the still image instead of live camera view. Picture Load feature is also implemented to work with any picture from your photo gallery. Zoom View feature helps to align object boundaries accurately.Partomter3D can be very useful if you need to measure bigger distances on the plane, where the simple ruler or tape is difficult to apply. All you need to do in this case is to place a rectangular object (credit card or sheet of paper) on the measurement plane, make sure that the object of interest fits into the camera view and make measurements.Thank you for your support.Follow us:Google+: +VisTechProjectsFacebook: vistech.projectsTwitter: @VTProjects  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vistechprojects.partometer3d", "price": "EGP18.73", "date_published": "February 13, 2014", "email": "vistech.projects@gmail.com", "downloads": "5,000 - 10,000", "category": "Productivity", "developer": "vistech.projects", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vistechprojects.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGe3LsX2vhG5Crj-7BazYS1DRUH1Q", "reviewers": "95"}

{"title": "MobileSitter", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=MobileSitter+GmbH", "rating": "4.309091091156006", "Description": " MobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, MobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to MobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. MobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using MobileSitter the stored passwords are secure.Besides a higher security level, MobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. MobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.MobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany.SECURITYMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service.MobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. MobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.Every decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker\u2019s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.To determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card.Further information can be found on http://www.mobilesitter.deFEATURES- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1- Group your secrets into folders- Alphabetic and user defined sorting- Search function- Easy data backup (Email, USB mass storage mode)- Encrypted backups- Auto Log-Off- Auto deletion of clipboard- Easy master password change- Easy device replacementIf you like MobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review.

{"title": "Clear Note Widget Sticky Notes", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=sandcastle", "rating": "4.22857141494751", "Description": " Keep your notes and reminders handy on your home screen. Clear Note Widget is a completely transparent Android sticky note app that lets you add a variety of note widgets. Great for shopping and to-do lists, general reminders, and personal quotes. Supports encryption/password-protected notes, note sending, multiple note widget background styles, and multiple widget sizes!Features* Clear Note Widgets are scrollable, transparent sticky notes that can be quickly and easily pinned to any home screen and edited just by tapping on them* Seamlessly blends into your home screen's background (completely transparent widget background) or choose a background color* Customize the background color, text color, and font sizes of your note widget* Create regular notepad notes with optional encryption/password-protection for maximum security* Note widgets are available in multiple sizes: 1x1, 2x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x1, 4x2 and 4x4 sizes (each home screen icon takes up 1 space) and resizable in Android 3.1+* No permissions required!* Send Note option lets you quickly and easily share your note through Gmail, text message, or your favorite email client* No ads or spyware of any kind* Small download: Clear Note Widget is less than 1 megabyte!* Free updates and support for life!FAQ:So what exactly is Clear Note Widget? Is it an app or a widget?- Both! Clear Note Widget's main feature lets you place transparent notes that blend in with your home screen, but it also functions pretty well as a standard note app (opening it through the shortcut). Regular (aka non-widget) notes can also be password-protected/encrypted.How do I add a widget to my home screen?- You'll first need to tap the App Drawer icon. This should bring up a list of your applications with two tabs near the top of the screen: Apps and Widgets. Tap the widgets tab, and scroll over to the right (swipe left) until you get to the Clear Note Widgets. From there, just tap on your desired size (you can always resize later*), hold, and you'll be able to drop the widget on any of your home screens.How do I resize a widget?- While on a home screen, press and hold a Clear Note Widget for about 1-2 seconds, then let go. You should see a box around your note widget with some blue \"handles\" at the corners. Drag the handles either towards or away from the widget, depending on whether you'd like the widget to be smaller or larger. *I can't seem to resize my widget to a smaller size. What's the deal?- You might be running Android 3.1 or 3.2. Android 3.1 introduced widget resizing but only above a minimum width and height. So a 2x2 widget could be resized anywhere between 2x2 and 4x4, but never smaller than 2x2. This was fixed in Android 4.0+, but aside from upgrading to Ice Cream Sandwich, the only solution is to add a 1x1 widget to the home screen (which will let you resize to any larger size and back).How do I create a regular note?- Regular notes (the non-sticky kind) can be created directly from the Clear Note Widget app. Just run Clear Note Widget from your App Drawer or the shortcut icon, and press the \"Create a New Note\" button!I don't like having to change my background color, text colors or font sizes every time. Help!- No problem! You can set up your default options (editor font size, background, text colors, font sizes) by tapping on the Settings icon (the one with the two circles) while editing a note or the notes list screen. There's a slight difference between the two: the widget note Settings menu lets you set your current widget options as the default, while the notes list Settings menu lets you select the actual default options!More Info:Twitter: @sandcastleccClear Note Widget Official Site: http://www.clearnotethis.comsandcastle: http://www.sandcastle.cc  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearnotewidget", "price": "EGP7.00", "date_published": "March 31, 2014", "email": "comments@clearnotethis.com", "downloads": "1,000 - 5,000", "category": "Productivity", "developer": "sandcastle", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "Varies with device", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.clearnotethis.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHTLK3sA2EQlCa539RBzwT7ANdzYw", "reviewers": "70"}

At Low, you will get notifications quickly, but won't save much battery. On Max, it can take up to 10 minutes to get notifications, but your battery will last up to 40 times longer.The app also keeps track of how much battery you have saved since you installed it, so you can know just how well it is working. These statistics can be reset by long-pressing the statistics bar on the main screen.It can automatically turn the radio off when your battery is low, and automatically turn it back on when you turn the screen on, plug it in to charge, or force it on. You can configure the delay before the radio is turned on when turning the screen on, so that you don't waste battery just checking the time.By tapping the Bluetooth icon on the app's main screen, you can set the mode to Force On, Force Off, or Automatic. The Force settings are temporary (will be removed on the next reboot) and can be used if it is important you receive notifications on time, or to force it off when you go to sleep to save even more battery.Leave a review if you find this app useful, we will try to keep up on reviews and integrate your feedback into the app to make it even better.We plan to add a scheduler as well, so you can automatically turn the radio off at night or when you're away so the battery can last even longer.

No matter what you need to track - text notes, quantities, custom hierarchical categories, gps coordinates - Tap Log probably has a way to log it with a minimal number of button presses. You can log events directly from the home screen with a single button tap. A limited set of charting options allows you to explore your data. (DEMO VERSION AVAILABLE)WHY?\u2022 Fast: large buttons, minimal keyboard use\u2022 Organized: pre-categorized\u2022 Consistent: log a broad range of data consistently\u2022 Flexible: record quantities, ratings, text notes, gps locations\u2022 Customizable: record exactly what you want\u2022 Exportable: Export to well-formatted CSV, or e-mail the log1.

Create a button and start collecting information.2. Tap buttons to create log entries(see example screen-shots) Set buttons in advance, eliminate time wasted typing poorly formatted and categorized notes. Collect data in a consistent format.

Send the log as a simple e-mail message.  Export CSV file to other apps (i.e. GDocs, DropBox) or to your computer to create reports, and make complex charts of your own.  Tap Log has a selection Charts for users to explore their data: Histograms by time of day and day of week, Pie Charts by subcategory, and by the amount of time subcategories were the last category logged (a time-card pattern).  Chart days, weeks, and months. Save favorite charts.  Share charts via Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.4. Fine-tune your data collection methods.Use widgets to create log entries directly from the home screen.  Easily edit buttons to make more categories (unlimited), create subcategories (limit 2), and add attributes you think would be helpful (i.e. rate each 'Restaurant' entry). Take advantage of your phone's features and log your GPS location with each entry.5. Transfer Data to a new phone. (Instructions Below)FEATURED USE CASES:\u2022 Business travelers, log and organize trip expenses, send report to a coworker as a simple e-mail message.\u2022 Categorize your professional activities, ditch the bulky log book and create a comprehensive log of your accomplished tasks, modifying as you go.\u2022 Create a simple text note in one button press.

Thousands of users have downloaded this useful application for performing quick and simple duct sizing analysis.The Duct Sizer application allows you to quickly size one HVAC duct run using the constant friction method. Think of this application as a digital version of the classic Trane Ductulator. In the \"Size by Airflow\" mode, you can specify the total airflow in CFM (or L/s), the aspect ratio and one of either the velocity of air or the friction loss per 100 feet (30 meters). The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions, the equivalent diameter (for rectangular and oval duct) and the calculated velocity and friction loss. In the \"Size by Dimensions\" mode, you can analyze an existing duct system. There are options to input the existing duct dimensions and one of either the airflow or velocity values to derive the calculated duct friction loss. You can specify additional parameters such as the duct shape (rectangular, round, or oval), the duct material type (10+ duct material items), duct roughness, the air temperature and the air pressure. You can also choose to display values in either English (IP) or Metric (SI) units.This application uses slider controls that allow you to quickly increment or decrement the input values and immediately observe the calculated results.In addition, you can email all inputs and results to any email address. The \"HVAC Duct Sizer\" application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a leader in HVAC design software since 1995. In fact, Autodesk (the makers of AutoCAD) acquired our load calculation software and incorporated it into their leading 3D modeling software called Revit. We currently offer 35+ apps for the iPhone and Android. In addition, we developed the ASHRAE 62.1 ventilation and Duct Fitting Database iPhone apps that are currently sold by ASHRAE, Inc.REGARDING COMMENTS BELOW:1. WE'VE ADDED THE FLEXIBLE DUCT, HELIX CORE DUCT MATERIAL TYPE TO THE DATABASE2. THE LATEST UPDATE HAS BEEN TESTED ON A VARIETY OF ANDROID SCREEN SIZES INCLUDING ANDROID PHONE/TABLET.

Our favorite way to run Freedom is to leave the phone on while blocking both cell and wifi data (we call it 1995 cell phone mode). And the best thing, Freedom is hard to stop - you have to wait until the timer ends so you can get back online! If you're the impatient type we do offer a preference setting that allows you to reboot the phone and clear blocks if you absolutely must (but you've got to choose this setting before starting your blocks!).

It is also perfect for parents who wish to allow their children to use a device but not endlessly browse the 'net.

Also get the available test builds & random fun messages from the team.AOKPush uses the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service provided by Google since Jelly Bean. GCM is integrated into the Android framework, eg. the application does not use any extra battery nor wakes up the device periodically to fetch data.There are 4 feeds you can subscribe to:- Milestone feed: official milestone releases by AOKP- Nightly feed: official (automatic) nightly releases by AOKP- Test feed: unofficial test releases by AOKP developers- Fun feed: messages from the Unicorn barnMessages can be sent automatically by the AOKP build server (milestone / nightly feeds) and manually by individual developers (test / fun feeds).The device sends data to the AOKPush server on each boot, after application upgrades, and when changing feed subscriptions. Sent data is less than 200 bytes. Received data is usually less than 1 KByte but cannot be more than 4 KBytes.The server stores only 4 entries about your device:- registration ID- device type- subscribed feeds- app versionThe registration ID is a unique ID generated by the GCM framework which identifies your device and allows the server to send you messages. No personal data is stored.You will receive the notifications even if you do not currently run AOKP. You can install it on currently not AOKP-supported devices, you will get a message once we release a build for that phone/tablet.You won't receive the messages that have been sent before you installed the app. Everything happens real-time.Zips can be downloaded directly in the application by clicking on one of the mirrors. In case the download fails, long press the mirror and the zip URL will be copied to your clipboard.

Please see \"known limitations\" below. All other BB devices work great!The 2Can YouTube channel has helpful how-to videos:http://www.youtube.com/user/2CanAppThe 2Can user guide is on our support site:http://2canapp.com/support.htm2Can uses your BBB or IPD BlackBerry backup file, so please make sure you can back up your BlackBerry, and that your Android phone shows up as a \"disk drive letter\" when you plug it into your PC. We show you how in the User Guide and the YouTube videos - it's really easy!If you have any questions PLEASE email me at the Email Developer link.Mac Users: There is one extra step for you right now. It's detailed in the User Guide, but let me know if you need any help and I'll walk you through it.KNOWN LIMITATIONS:0. 2Can does not work with the brand-new BlackBerry Z10 or Q10 phones. 99% of you out there have older BlackBerrys, and you'll be fine. If you new Z10 or Q10 owners have a backup file from an older phone, that's all you need for 2Can to do its magic.1. Please note 2Can will not transfer your calendar (yet).2. 2Can won't transfer the photos of your BlackBerry contacts. This has not been a major issue so far, as FaceBook and Google+ sync eventually add your contacts photos in over time.3. Your SMS messages will be stored in a color-coded 2Can file, not in the phone's native SMS app. You'll see everything, but you won't be able to reply. The reason? There is no unified API for Android SMS messages. Each phone manufacturer was allowed to implement SMS independently, with no published spec for interface. I had no choice on this one, sorry!4. 2Can works with English/Spanish characters: A-Z,a-z,0-9,etc. 2Can can't handle other character sets such as Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, etc.Folks, I will help you with ANY problem you run into with 2Can!

{"title": "Aircraft VOR", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Sensorworks", "rating": "4.191489219665527", "Description": " Aircraft VOR provides you with a GPS based aircraft VOR instrument shown as a typical Bendix/King KI-208A instrument.It lets you 'tune' aircraft navigation Very High Frequency Omni-direction range (VOR) beacons via a worldwide database and allows you to select and track a VOR radial to or from the VOR station.It also optionally shows you your cross-track deviation in metres.Features: - Bendix/King KI-208A face - Worldwide VOR navigation database (downloaded on first use) - Digital CRS and distance to station indications - Option to display cross-track error  - Filtered and smoothed display - no jitter or jumping! - Support for portrait and landscape screens - Support for multiple screen resolutionsUsageIMPORTANT POINT 1 - Please ensure you have an active data connection when starting the app for the first time as it will attempt to download the radio navigation database.Don't use it until you know its working! Until a GPS fix is obtained, or in case of GPS fix being lost, the VOR on/off indicator will be shown and the distance to station will show ---- Tuning a station Use the app menu to select 'Tune NAV'. You will be presented with all the VOR stations within 200 nautical miles of your current location. Selecting a VOR will tune it up. Hit your devices 'Back' button when you have selected your desired VOR. Finding out which radial you currently on The first thing to remember when trying to find out which radial you are on is that all radials are from the station. The indicator is able to show you which direction to track to the station but this is not directly which radial you are on (it's 180 degrees out). To centre the needle and find the radial you are currently on, rotate the instruments compass card until the needle centres with a FROM indication. Finding out your current bearing to the station Sometimes it is necessary to obtain your current bearing to station. To obtain the bearing from your current position to the station, rotate the instruments compass card until the needle is centred and the TO flag is showing. Flying a specific radialSometimes it is necessary to fly along a specific radial to/from the station. In this case, first select the radial you wish to fly by rotating the instruments compass card to that radial, ensuring the TO/FROM flag is in the correct sense. The VOR needle will then indicate to you which direction you need to move in order to intercept your desired radial. If the needle is to the right, fly right. If it is to the left, fly left. Upon approaching your desired radial, the needle will close into the centre. Each dot indicated on the display is 2 degrees, so the needle will start to move when you are within 10 degrees of the desired radial. You should begin to turn onto a desired course, which matches your radial so that your aircraft heading matches the desired radial when the needle is centred. You will need to compensate for wind appropriately. Displaying X-Track deviation You can display you current cross-track error in metres by toggling the menu option. This will show you the number of metres left or right of track when you close to less than 1km of your desired radial For further information check out http://www.wikihow.com/Navigate-Using-a-VORIf you like this app, please try my other aircraft/flying related apps!
