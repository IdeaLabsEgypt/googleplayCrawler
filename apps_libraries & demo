{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Frakbot", "Description": " Please note that this is an old version of the demo app and libraryThis entry will not be updated anymore. Please refer to the sources on GitHub: https://github.com/rock3r/glowpadbackportThe sample app for the GlowPadBackport library. You can find out more at https://github.com/rock3r/GlowPadBackportThe GlowPadView is that View that Google uses in Android 4.1 and 4.2 (and, in a slightly different flavour, on Android 4.0 as well) on both the insecure lockscreen and the Incoming call Activity. It's the circular grid of dots, with a central handle that the user can grab to various customizable targets.Google decided to only provide a private implementation of that View in AOSP. It's not an SDK-facing View, it has lots of internal APIs references, and doesn't work in older versions of Android. What I have done is I have rewritten part of the code to work on Android SDK versions starting with Android 1.6 Donut, which is to mean it runs pretty much on any hardware out there. Of course performance is not going to be buttery smooth on older OS versions if the hardware is not up to it. Still, it can work decently even on underpowered hardware such as the i'm Watch Android smartwatch (you have to decrease the points count multiplier to 3-4 from the default of 8 thou). I also exposed a couple more functions that aren't available on the AOSP internal version, such as the ability to change the points count. This means you can use the GlowPadView in any of your apps, and create custom Holo-like lockscreens for older versions of Android.This is not going to be of any use to common users. This is just a proof-of-concept of how to get the library working.The VIBRATE permission is required to have haptic feedback when the user interacts with the GlowPadView.Keywords: Glow Pad, GlowPad, GlowPadView, Android Development, AndDev, Library, Demo, Sample, UI, View, Backport, GlowPadBackport, GitHub  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sebastianopoggi.samples.ui.GlowPadSample", "category": "Libraries & Demo", "title": "GlowPadSample", "email": "poggos+glowpadsample@gmail.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "developer": "Frakbot", "price": "0", "rating": "3.8758621215820312", "operating_system": "1.6 and up", "content_rating": "Everyone", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/rock3r/GlowPadBackport&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHkLY6ejtUWyo5SyFsSbfFGiKzpaw", "date_published": "January 29, 2013", "reviewers": "145"}

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Robert+Theis", "Description": " Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR).Runs the Tesseract 3.03 open source OCR engine to find text in images captured by the device camera.This app runs OCR on your device--without uploading your images to a server--and is suitable for recognizing individual words or short phrases of text. Translation (powered by Google/Microsoft) can be run after OCR.The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that's captured when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo.When the \"continuous preview\" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic, real-time display of what the device is recognizing right beside the camera viewfinder. The continuous preview mode works best on a fast device.USING THIS APP- Point the device at a small region of text and touch the on-screen shutter button to start OCR.- To copy text to the clipboard or share text, long-press on the text after pressing the shutter button.- For recognizing individual Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters, set the page segmentation mode to \"single character.\"RECOGNITION ACCURACY- Various factors can cause the OCR to fail: uneven illumination, stylized text, or text without enough contrast from the background. Try to have good lighting.- Hold the device steady, and be sure the picture is in focus.- If you need to scan a large block of text or an entire document, consider using a flatbed scanner or a document scanning app such as TextFairy instead.LANGUAGES- This app supports several languages not supported by Google Goggles/Google Translate. - Supported languages for OCR: Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Azeri, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian (Latin), Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.- Arabic OCR requires a large amount of RAM. If your device doesn't have enough RAM, the app will quit during OCR.SAMSUNG DEVICE NOTES- On Samsung Galaxy devices, you may need to long-press the menu button to set preferences.- You may get better results if you un-check \"Standard focus mode\".DEVELOPMENT NOTES- This is an open source project. The source code is available at https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr.- Since the release of this app, Google Goggles has added a \"continuous mode\" and Google Translate has added OCR-based translations. There is also one VC-funded startup that has used this app as a starting point.- Thanks to the contributors: Spoorthi, Hunvil, Jingjing, Xuyuan, and Mandar.My latest translation app: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rmtheis.translator  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.sfsu.cs.orange.ocr", "category": "Libraries & Demo", "title": "OCR Test", "email": "robert.m.theis@gmail.com", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "developer": "Robert Theis", "price": "0", "rating": "3.289562225341797", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "content_rating": "Everyone", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.rmtheis.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEGF79eooR66M6Rfeh1cepeMu3hQw", "date_published": "May 11, 2014", "reviewers": "594"}

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=ANT%2B", "Description": " The ANT USB Service enables ANT wireless communication over a supported* ANT USB stick connected to your phone in conjunction with the ANT Radio Service. Among other use cases, ANT wireless technology allows communication with millions of ANT+ devices in existence, including some of the most popular sport, fitness and personal health applications such as a heart rate straps, running foot pods, cycling power meters, weight scales, blood pressure monitors and more. More information on ANT and ANT+ technology is available on the ANT Radio Service download page: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.service.socket and on our website: http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/ant-in-phones/ANT+ enabled applications typically also require downloading the ANT+ Plugins http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.plugins.antplus. *Known Limitations: -Not compatible with \"USB1\" ANT sticks (sorry, we know a lot of you would like this but the USB1 uses a different USB controller which is not compatible with our newer versions)-Connection of ANT USB sticks requires your phone to have USB Host support, if the Play Store allows you to install this ANT USB Service on your phone, your phone should support USB Host, and all that is required is a USB OTG cable and an ANT USB Stick. For detailed requirements please visit http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/ant-in-phones/.-Some devices (eg Motorola XOOM, Gateway TP-A60/Acer Iconia A500) will suspend the USB when the screen turns off, which will kill any ANT connections. This is a hardware limitation and a workaround must be added by individual apps.-Applications using very old versions of our interfaces may only work with built-in ANT support and not support ANT devices attached via this USB Service. In this case your only option is to encourage the developers of that application to update their app to use a more recent version. (If your application is not detecting the USB stick, please test if one of our sample apps can detect it, for example you can install and test the ANT+ Plugins and the ANT+ Plugin Sampler. If you can connect to the stick with some apps, but not others, it probably indicates that the problem apps are using the very old legacy interfaces.)

I have also added several features not found in the original implementation including touch screen support, VBOs and an on-screen FPS counter.The FPS (frames-per-second) counter is often used as a benchmark metric for graphics programs. On Android the frame rate is limited by v-sync (typically 60 FPS) which is the fastest rate that a display can refresh the screen.

Many users, especially subscribers of Beeline, when dialing is not in my notebook, after the connection instead of the original number shows \"Unknown.\" After a call from the call log also shows \"Unknown.\" Call this number to impossible. The problem lies at the junction of the liability of operators and Sony.This patch fixes a problem. After a call, the call log will show the dialed number. During the call of the word \"Unknown\" does not disappear.If you do not have this problem, do not install this patch.Root is not needed.After installing the patch works automatically. Running the application, you can enable / disable patch (for example to check whether Sony has eliminated the problem in a future update.) And also be able to voluntarily support the developer.)Permissions:1) Redirect outgoing calls: No calls are forwarded, it is necessary to remember the number of the call to the system for some reason, it will erase.2) Read the status and device id: need to know when the call is completed to fix after the book calls.3, 4) Record / viewing the call log: obvious.5) Disable hibernation: only if the phone is not exactly asleep until the write operation in the call log is completed.6) Payment System Google Play: to give everyone an opportunity to thank the developer :)  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cultcargo.callfixer", "category": "Libraries & Demo", "title": "Xperia \u041d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0410\u0431\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442 Fix", "email": "imseleznev@ya.ru", "downloads": "1,000 - 5,000", "developer": "CultCargo Studio", "price": "0", "rating": "4.38095235824585", "operating_system": "2.3.3 and up", "content_rating": "Everyone", "date_published": "April 4, 2014", "reviewers": "105"}

Also, based on preference, app can also check the homography of the matched keypoints with LMED (least of median squares) and remove the outliners to give a better result. How to use:1 - Move the vision wherever you want, take pics along the way by using ADD button.2 - You can also take a reference picture, that you want to be recognized. When you click it, it will be shown on the right of the camera view.3 - When you are done, and make sure you have added images and have a reference image, click the Find Match button. It will calculate the keypoints of each image and the reference image and apply the matching algorithm. 4 - After matching and comparing, it will show the best match among all matches.5 - You can also use Homography Off/On switch to provide more accurate results.6 - Also, you can use Images only/with matches switch to show which keypoints are matched. REMEMBER, you have to click find match again to see the effect of Homography and Matches switch.This app is still in development, actually being used by another project but I put it on for cool demonstration!

A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it closes the Advent season and initiates the twelve days of Christmastide.[7] Christmas is a civil holiday in many of the world's nations,[8][9][10] is celebrated by an increasing number of non-Christians,[1][11][12] and is an integral part of the Christmas and holiday season.The precise date of Jesus' birth, which some historians place between 7 and 2 BC, is unknown.[13][14] By the early-to-mid 4th century, the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25,[15] a date later adopted in the East.[16][17] The date of Christmas may have initially been chosen to correspond with the day exactly nine months after early Christians believed Jesus to have been conceived,[18] as well as the date of the southern solstice (i.e., the Roman winter solstice), with a sun connection being possible because Christians consider Jesus to be the \"Sun of righteousness\" prophesied in Malachi 4:2.[18][19][20][21][22]The original date of the celebration in Eastern Christianity was January 6, in connection with Epiphany, and that is still the date of the celebration for the Armenian Apostolic Church and in Armenia, where it is a public holiday. As of 2012, there is a difference of 13 days between the modern Gregorian calendar and the older Julian calendar. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December 25 and January 6 on what for the majority of the world is January 7 and January 19. For this reason, Ethiopia, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, the Republic of Macedonia, and the Republic of Moldova celebrate Christmas on what in the Gregorian calendar is January 7; all the Greek Orthodox Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25.This app contains many different kinds of Christmas sound effects your your ringtone application.You can set your desired sound to default ringtone, ringtone for a particular person, notification and alarm.An outstanding feature is that this app will search all the music content in your phone and put them into a library folder, you are free to select any of these songs as ringtone as well.How to operate ;-\tPress and hold down your desired ringtone until a pop up menu appears, select provided options at your desired.-\tBy pressing the \"STAR\" icon, the corresponding ringtone will be stored in favorite folder fro easy retrieval later.-\tYou can listen to the ringtones by pressing the Play/Pause icons.-\tPress the \"SD\" icon on the top to switch to music library.This app has very simple UI, please have fun !

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Cainteoir+Technologies", "Description": " The eSpeak engine is a small, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) program that supports a large number of languages. It has a more robotic sounding voice than other engines due to its small size (see http://espeak.sourceforge.net/samples/raven.ogg for an example of what it sounds like). The trade-off for this somewhat harsher sound is a very responsive and resource-friendly engine with voices which remain intelligible at much higher speeds than other, more human-sounding alternatives.This is a port of eSpeak to Android for 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later (including Android 4.3), supporting all 79 languages and accents of eSpeak (see http://reecedunn.co.uk/espeak-for-android for the list).It is built on the eyes-free version, fixing multiple issues found in the eyes-free version:1.  Compatibility with Android 4.3 (as of 1.47.11d);2. Speech rate and pitch are correctly handled, so eSpeak on Android sounds like it does on the desktop;3.  Speech rate is set as words per minute4.  Pitch, base pitch and volume are configurable as percentages.5.  The eSpeak variant can be selected, including the NVDA voice variants.6.  Punctuation level and punctuation characters are configurable.7. Languages are correctly selected (e.g. selecting Slovak and Slovenian, or selecting Cantonese Chinese);8. Language names are correctly displayed (e.g. \"Scottish English\" is displayed as \"English (United Kingdom, Scottish Standard English)\" instead of \"English (Saychelles)\");9. Accent and special characters are supported;10. MIPS-based devices are supported;11. Various memory leaks and crashes are fixed;12. SSML is only processed if the SSML markup is wrapped in a  tag.13.  Support for importing custom-built eSpeak dictionaries.NOTE: When enabling eSpeak, you will get a message stating \"This speech synthesis engine may be able to collect all the text that will be spoken, including personal data like passwords and credit card numbers. It comes from the eSpeak engine. Enable the use of this speech synthesis engine?\". This is a standard warning issued by Android devices for accessibility software that comes from an external source.The eSpeak engine does not collect any data in the text passed to it. All the source code to the core eSpeak engine and the Android port is available for you to verify this if you are concerned.eSpeak: http://espeak.sourceforge.net/eSpeak for Android: https://github.com/rhdunn/espeak/tree/androidAny issues should be reported to https://github.com/rhdunn/espeak/issues.The flags in the feature graphic are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike by Wikipedia.
