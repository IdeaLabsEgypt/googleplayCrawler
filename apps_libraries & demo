It can get info about an app's description, category, price, etc. on the Google Play Store. The info is used in other apps (like ROM Toolbox or Ultimate Backup) to create app groups or show you additional information about one of your installed apps.The reason this is a separate app is because of the permissions it requires. This app is open source, which means you can know exactly what the app does. The permissions to your accounts is only used to generate a token used in the Android Market API. This is explained here: http://code.google.com/p/android-market-api/wiki/WithAndroidWe didn't want to just add those permissions to the main app. This same API is used by apps like Titanium Backup. We just made this a separate app so users won't complain so much about a permission being added :PIf you have any additional questions please feel free to contact us at jrummy.apps@gmail.comproject: https://bitbucket.org/JRummy16/market-api-helper  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.apps.google.play.api", "price": "0", "date_published": "July 15, 2013", "email": "jrummy.apps@gmail.com", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "category": "Libraries & Demo", "developer": "JRummy Apps Inc.", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.0 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://support.jrummyapps.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFVnRA8Shi84c2MD5NLQ79FBuc_NA", "reviewers": "3811"}

Please refer to the sources on GitHub: https://github.com/rock3r/glowpadbackportThe sample app for the GlowPadBackport library. You can find out more at https://github.com/rock3r/GlowPadBackportThe GlowPadView is that View that Google uses in Android 4.1 and 4.2 (and, in a slightly different flavour, on Android 4.0 as well) on both the insecure lockscreen and the Incoming call Activity. It's the circular grid of dots, with a central handle that the user can grab to various customizable targets.Google decided to only provide a private implementation of that View in AOSP. It's not an SDK-facing View, it has lots of internal APIs references, and doesn't work in older versions of Android. What I have done is I have rewritten part of the code to work on Android SDK versions starting with Android 1.6 Donut, which is to mean it runs pretty much on any hardware out there. Of course performance is not going to be buttery smooth on older OS versions if the hardware is not up to it. Still, it can work decently even on underpowered hardware such as the i'm Watch Android smartwatch (you have to decrease the points count multiplier to 3-4 from the default of 8 thou). I also exposed a couple more functions that aren't available on the AOSP internal version, such as the ability to change the points count. This means you can use the GlowPadView in any of your apps, and create custom Holo-like lockscreens for older versions of Android.This is not going to be of any use to common users. This is just a proof-of-concept of how to get the library working.The VIBRATE permission is required to have haptic feedback when the user interacts with the GlowPadView.Keywords: Glow Pad, GlowPad, GlowPadView, Android Development, AndDev, Library, Demo, Sample, UI, View, Backport, GlowPadBackport, GitHub  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sebastianopoggi.samples.ui.GlowPadSample", "price": "0", "date_published": "January 29, 2013", "email": "poggos+glowpadsample@gmail.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "category": "Libraries & Demo", "developer": "Frakbot", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "1.6 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/rock3r/GlowPadBackport&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHkLY6ejtUWyo5SyFsSbfFGiKzpaw", "reviewers": "145"}

{"title": "OCR Test", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Robert+Theis", "rating": "3.289562225341797", "Description": " Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR).Runs the Tesseract 3.03 open source OCR engine to find text in images captured by the device camera.This app runs OCR on your device--without uploading your images to a server--and is suitable for recognizing individual words or short phrases of text. Translation (powered by Google/Microsoft) can be run after OCR.The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that's captured when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo.When the \"continuous preview\" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic, real-time display of what the device is recognizing right beside the camera viewfinder. The continuous preview mode works best on a fast device.USING THIS APP- Point the device at a small region of text and touch the on-screen shutter button to start OCR.- To copy text to the clipboard or share text, long-press on the text after pressing the shutter button.- For recognizing individual Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters, set the page segmentation mode to \"single character.\"RECOGNITION ACCURACY- Various factors can cause the OCR to fail: uneven illumination, stylized text, or text without enough contrast from the background. Try to have good lighting.- Hold the device steady, and be sure the picture is in focus.- If you need to scan a large block of text or an entire document, consider using a flatbed scanner or a document scanning app such as TextFairy instead.LANGUAGES- This app supports several languages not supported by Google Goggles/Google Translate. - Supported languages for OCR: Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Azeri, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian (Latin), Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.- Arabic OCR requires a large amount of RAM. If your device doesn't have enough RAM, the app will quit during OCR.SAMSUNG DEVICE NOTES- On Samsung Galaxy devices, you may need to long-press the menu button to set preferences.- You may get better results if you un-check \"Standard focus mode\".DEVELOPMENT NOTES- This is an open source project. The source code is available at https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr.- Since the release of this app, Google Goggles has added a \"continuous mode\" and Google Translate has added OCR-based translations. There is also one VC-funded startup that has used this app as a starting point.- Thanks to the contributors: Spoorthi, Hunvil, Jingjing, Xuyuan, and Mandar.My latest translation app: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rmtheis.translator  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.sfsu.cs.orange.ocr", "price": "0", "date_published": "May 11, 2014", "email": "robert.m.theis@gmail.com", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "category": "Libraries & Demo", "developer": "Robert Theis", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.rmtheis.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEGF79eooR66M6Rfeh1cepeMu3hQw", "reviewers": "594"}

{"title": "ANT USB Service", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=ANT%2B", "rating": "3.9743590354919434", "Description": " The ANT USB Service enables ANT wireless communication over a supported* ANT USB stick connected to your phone in conjunction with the ANT Radio Service. Among other use cases, ANT wireless technology allows communication with millions of ANT+ devices in existence, including some of the most popular sport, fitness and personal health applications such as a heart rate straps, running foot pods, cycling power meters, weight scales, blood pressure monitors and more. More information on ANT and ANT+ technology is available on the ANT Radio Service download page: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.service.socket and on our website: http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/ant-in-phones/ANT+ enabled applications typically also require downloading the ANT+ Plugins http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.plugins.antplus. *Known Limitations: -Not compatible with \"USB1\" ANT sticks (sorry, we know a lot of you would like this but the USB1 uses a different USB controller which is not compatible with our newer versions)-Connection of ANT USB sticks requires your phone to have USB Host support, if the Play Store allows you to install this ANT USB Service on your phone, your phone should support USB Host, and all that is required is a USB OTG cable and an ANT USB Stick. For detailed requirements please visit http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/ant-in-phones/.-Some devices (eg Motorola XOOM, Gateway TP-A60/Acer Iconia A500) will suspend the USB when the screen turns off, which will kill any ANT connections. This is a hardware limitation and a workaround must be added by individual apps.-Applications using very old versions of our interfaces may only work with built-in ANT support and not support ANT devices attached via this USB Service. In this case your only option is to encourage the developers of that application to update their app to use a more recent version. (If your application is not detecting the USB stick, please test if one of our sample apps can detect it, for example you can install and test the ANT+ Plugins and the ANT+ Plugin Sampler. If you can connect to the stick with some apps, but not others, it probably indicates that the problem apps are using the very old legacy interfaces.)

I have also added several features not found in the original implementation including touch screen support, VBOs and an on-screen FPS counter.The FPS (frames-per-second) counter is often used as a benchmark metric for graphics programs. On Android the frame rate is limited by v-sync (typically 60 FPS) which is the fastest rate that a display can refresh the screen.

Many users, especially subscribers of Beeline, when dialing is not in my notebook, after the connection instead of the original number shows \"Unknown.\" After a call from the call log also shows \"Unknown.\" Call this number to impossible. The problem lies at the junction of the liability of operators and Sony.This patch fixes a problem. After a call, the call log will show the dialed number.

It uses ORB feature detector with BRIEF descriptor extractors. It uses BRUTEFORCE_HAMMING method to match the descriptors. Also, based on preference, app can also check the homography of the matched keypoints with LMED (least of median squares) and remove the outliners to give a better result. How to use:1 - Move the vision wherever you want, take pics along the way by using ADD button.2 - You can also take a reference picture, that you want to be recognized. When you click it, it will be shown on the right of the camera view.3 - When you are done, and make sure you have added images and have a reference image, click the Find Match button. It will calculate the keypoints of each image and the reference image and apply the matching algorithm. 4 - After matching and comparing, it will show the best match among all matches.5 - You can also use Homography Off/On switch to provide more accurate results.6 - Also, you can use Images only/with matches switch to show which keypoints are matched. REMEMBER, you have to click find match again to see the effect of Homography and Matches switch.This app is still in development, actually being used by another project but I put it on for cool demonstration!

{"title": "Shot Guns", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=gardnerallie60", "rating": "4.4285712242126465", "Description": " A shotgun (also known as a scattergun and peppergun, or historically as a fowling piece) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug. Shotguns come in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 5.5 mm (.22 inch) bore up to 5 cm (2 inch) bore, and in a range of firearm operating mechanisms, including breech loading, single-barreled, double or combination gun, pump-action, bolt-, and lever-action, semi-automatic, and even fully automatic variants.A shotgun is generally a smoothbore firearm, which means that the inside of the barrel is not rifled. Preceding smoothbore firearms, such as the musket, were widely used by armies in the 18th century. The direct ancestor to the shotgun, the blunderbuss, was also used in a similar variety of roles from self defence to riot control. It was often used by cavalry troops due to its generally shorter length and ease of use, as well as by coachmen for its substantial power. However, in the 19th century, these weapons were largely replaced on the battlefield with breechloading rifled firearms, which were more accurate over longer ranges. The military value of shotguns was rediscovered in the First World War, when American forces used 12-gauge pump action shotguns in close-quarters trench fighting to great effect. Since then, it has been used in a variety of roles in civilian, law enforcement, and military applications.The shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power of the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy of any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. However, in a military or law enforcement context, the large number of projectiles makes the shotgun useful as a close quarters combat weapon or a defensive weapon. Shotguns are also used for target shooting sports such as skeet, trap, and sporting clays. These involve shooting clay disks, known as clay pigeons, thrown in various ways.The typical use of a shotgun is against small and/or fast moving targets, often taken while in the air. The spreading of the shot allows the user to point the shotgun close to the target, rather than having to aim precisely as in the case of a single projectile. The disadvantages of shot are limited range and limited penetration of the shot, which is why shotguns are used at short ranges, and typically against smaller targets. Larger shot size, up to the extreme case of the single projectile slug load, results in increased penetration, but at the expense of fewer projectiles and lower probability of hitting the target.Aside from the most common use against small, fast moving targets, the shotgun has several advantages when used against still targets. First, it has enormous stopping power at short range, more than nearly all handguns and many rifles. Though many believe the shotgun is a great firearm for inexperienced shooters, the truth is, at close range, the spread of shot is not very large at all, and competency in aiming is still required. A typical self-defense load of buckshot contains 8-27 large lead pellets, resulting in many wound tracks in the target. Also, unlike a fully jacketed rifle bullet, each pellet of shot is less likely to penetrate walls and hit bystanders.

This allows you to easily develop an application with an action bar for every version of Android from 2.x and up.The demo sample is a showcase of the functionality of the library (most notably, the action bar). There are several demos of different functionality but the most important is the feature toggles.

{"title": "eSpeak", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Cainteoir+Technologies", "rating": "4.121212005615234", "Description": " The eSpeak engine is a small, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) program that supports a large number of languages. It has a more robotic sounding voice than other engines due to its small size (see http://espeak.sourceforge.net/samples/raven.ogg for an example of what it sounds like). The trade-off for this somewhat harsher sound is a very responsive and resource-friendly engine with voices which remain intelligible at much higher speeds than other, more human-sounding alternatives.This is a port of eSpeak to Android for 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later (including Android 4.3), supporting all 79 languages and accents of eSpeak (see http://reecedunn.co.uk/espeak-for-android for the list).It is built on the eyes-free version, fixing multiple issues found in the eyes-free version:1.  Compatibility with Android 4.3 (as of 1.47.11d);2. Speech rate and pitch are correctly handled, so eSpeak on Android sounds like it does on the desktop;3.  Speech rate is set as words per minute4.  Pitch, base pitch and volume are configurable as percentages.5.  The eSpeak variant can be selected, including the NVDA voice variants.6.  Punctuation level and punctuation characters are configurable.7. Languages are correctly selected (e.g. selecting Slovak and Slovenian, or selecting Cantonese Chinese);8. Language names are correctly displayed (e.g. \"Scottish English\" is displayed as \"English (United Kingdom, Scottish Standard English)\" instead of \"English (Saychelles)\");9. Accent and special characters are supported;10. MIPS-based devices are supported;11. Various memory leaks and crashes are fixed;12. SSML is only processed if the SSML markup is wrapped in a  tag.13.  Support for importing custom-built eSpeak dictionaries.NOTE: When enabling eSpeak, you will get a message stating \"This speech synthesis engine may be able to collect all the text that will be spoken, including personal data like passwords and credit card numbers. It comes from the eSpeak engine. Enable the use of this speech synthesis engine?\". This is a standard warning issued by Android devices for accessibility software that comes from an external source.The eSpeak engine does not collect any data in the text passed to it. All the source code to the core eSpeak engine and the Android port is available for you to verify this if you are concerned.eSpeak: http://espeak.sourceforge.net/eSpeak for Android: https://github.com/rhdunn/espeak/tree/androidAny issues should be reported to https://github.com/rhdunn/espeak/issues.The flags in the feature graphic are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike by Wikipedia.
