So they want to keep learning.\u2605\u2605\u2605 What will my children learn? \u2605\u2605\u2605Like all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.

Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won't be practicing during this game. Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.Although it's perfect for preschoolers, who just love the game, many children of kindergarten age and in the early grades also enjoy snapping the puzzle pieces into place and learning the 100-plus images (in the full version) the puzzles represent.\u2714 Our games are laser focused. For example, the numbers game doesn't teach letters, and the letters game doesn't teach math. We keep the games simple but magically inviting and nourishing.\u2714 We strive to give children just the right balance between education and fun. So our games don't feature fun at the expense of education \u2013 or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated don\u2019t involve and delight kids.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Out+Of+Touch+Productions", "Description": " Teaching kids to spell includes much more than a list of spelling words students should memorize and write on a spelling test each week. Effective spelling methods do not rely on rote memorization, but are developmentally appropriate and hands-on. Word Study is a widely research-based spelling approach whose purpose is to \u201cexamine words in order to reveal the logic and consistencies within [the] written language system and to help student achieve mastery in recognizing, spelling, and defining specific words\u201d (Words Their Way, Bear, et. al, 2012). Word Study is developmentally appropriate because it takes into consideration what the student understands or does not yet understand about spellings and word meanings to discover where spelling instruction should start. This is accomplished by looking at the student\u2019s misspellings of certain word patterns (from simple words like man to more complex words such as multitude). It is hands-on in that it requires students to analyze, manipulate, and create meaningful and logical generalizations of how word spellings work. Short Vowels Word Study app is based on the Word Study approach described above and is for students in the late Letter Name-Alphabetic Spellers to early Within Word Pattern Spellers, according to the spelling development levels of Words Their Way.Short Vowels Word Study helps kids learn the spelling patterns related to word families and short vowel words through developmentally appropriate and hands-on spelling activities.Short Vowels Word Study teaches kids who are ready for:>  word families,>  short vowel words (CVC), and>  longer short vowel words with blends and diagraphs (CCVC and CVCC)SPELLING ACTIVITIES:SORT IT  -  Sorting words based on their spelling pattern.FIND IT  -  Analyzing words based on their patterns and finding the one that does not fit based on its phonics sound or visual pattern.SPELL IT  -  Manipulating letter tiles to spell short vowel words.WRITE IT  -  Spelling short vowel words by tracing and writing the word.Short Vowels Word Study Bonus Sections:-  a parent section that explains the theory behind the spelling activities included in the app-  a \u201cWord Fun\u201d section, where kids can play spelling games after earning stars from their spelling activitiesKids Safe,  No Adds or In-App purchases!,  please see our Privacy PolicyPRIVACY POLICYWe take privacy very seriously:Does not contain adsDoes not contain integration with social networksDoes not use analytics / data collection toolsDoes not contain in-app purchasesDoes contain web links for parentsTo read more about teaching kids to spell through a developmental approach to spelling, visit This Reading Mama or purchase her book, Teaching Kids to Spell.http://thisreadingmama.com/http://thisreadingmama.com/teaching-kids-to-spell/  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.quikclosepro.ShortVowels", "category": "Educational", "title": "Short Vowel Word Study", "email": "quikclosepro@gmail.com", "downloads": "10 - 50", "developer": "Out Of Touch Productions", "price": "EGP21.38", "rating": "0", "operating_system": "2.3.3 and up", "content_rating": "Everyone", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.thisreadingmama.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE0Nd3RhL4L94HRqgxxo8iijCijQg", "date_published": "September 16, 2014", "reviewers": "0"}

The sun rises higher and shines brighter.Our magazine will take you and your child on a fascinating journey into the world of work. The magazine is for children aged 2 to 5. With colourful pictures and interesting tasks about different professions, it will help introduce your child to the world around us. Tasks to develop children's attention, imagination, logical thinking, memory and speaking skills - all so important from an early age - are included in the magazine.How does it work?  Tasks go from the easiest to the more difficult, so we recommend doing the tasks in order. This will help your child gain confidence and go further without losing interest in the subject.While working with the magazine it is recommended to do no more than 3 to 4 tasks at a sitting. Do the tasks with your child, taking about and explaining the more challenging tasks. This will help your child to improve reasoning skills and to give his or her own point of view.A great advantage of the magazine is that you can go back to a task again and again, as often as your child wishes. This will help improve the cognitative activity of your child, which will be very useful in the future at school.This is DEMO version of the appA lot of Interactive Magazine are in the apphttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whisperarts.kids.journalLanguage: englishWant to receive the latest news about the application?

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Hedgehog+Academy", "Description": " This educational game for kids trains speech and logic. It is best for children ages 4, 5, 6 and 7 years old.Each of the tasks presents a sequence of pictures on the screen that together tell a story, yet the pictures get mixed at the start of the round. The child has to put the pictures back into the correct order and tell the story these pictures display. The game effectively trains the ability to speak in complete and meaningful sentences as well as to come to logical conclusions based on observed facts. To place the pictures in the correct order, children need to first establish causal, temporal, spatial and other logic relationships between the smaller pieces and demonstrate a rather high level of abstraction. Examining pictures itself trains attention and concentration.Ask your kid to tell a short story or in some way explain why the pictures should be in that order as well as what happens on the pictures. Each story has a beginning, then some development, and finally an ending. All the pictures are realistic, colorful, and aimed at young kids.The game offers tasks with 3 levels of difficulty:1. Easy - sequences of 4 easy pictures (for example, 1. whole apple, 2. bitten apple, 3. half-eaten apple, 4. apple core)2. Medium - sequences of 4 pictures which together make a small story with a simple plot3. Hard - sequences of 5-6 pictures with a longer plot where the child needs to establish temporal and causal relationshipsHedgehog Academy develops fun educational games and puzzles for kids, and each of them has a free Android version.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=For+Dyslexia", "Description": " *** Learn the sounds and shapes of letters of the alphabet with MULTISENSORY games! *** *** Developed in collaboration with experts in the field of education and reading difficulties. *** Alphabetics will capture the attention of your child while she or he plays games that teach the shapes and sounds of the alphabet. It is a wonderful app for phonemic awareness and shape recognition! Also a terrific app for children learning English as a foreign language! Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in language and are an important step for learning how to read. Children will learn the most common phoneme of each letter of the alphabet with I Can Alphabetics. Alphabetics is the first app of the I Can Suite. It was designed for children aged 3-6, but if your child is still struggling with beginning reading skills, it can be used at any age. For Dyslexia has done its best to assure the effectiveness of the app by consulting scientific and educational experts in the field of dyslexia. We are especially grateful to the mentorship provided by Dr. Guinevere Eden, Immediate Past President of the International Dyslexia Association and Director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University. What is taught: \u2022The shape and principal sound of each letter of the alphabet. How it is taught: \u2022Through a series of simple exercises, children will hear, trace, pronounce and identify the letters. The letters are introduced in 6 small sets. After they complete a series of multisensory exercises, they are quizzed on their understanding before they can move on to the next set of letters. How parents and tutors can use it: \u2022Through individualized Progress Reports parents and tutors can follow what children have practiced and learned for each letter of the alphabet. This app is appropriate to use with children who have dyslexia because, as Margaret Byrd Rawson, former President of the International Dyslexia Association (IDA), put so well: \u201cDyslexic students need a different approach to learning language from that employed in most classrooms. They need to be taught, slowly and thoroughly, the basic elements of their language\u2014the sounds and the letters which represent them\u2014and how to put these together and take them apart.

This was developed for my children and I decided to share it. It is minimal, no flashing lights or loud sound effects. Just quick math problems. The timer can be set from one to six minutes.The input process uses two number wheels that can be tapped, dragged and flung individually. This allows a beginning student to calculate and enter the one's column first, followed by the ten's column quickly, unlike most text entry. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division practice problems are all available. Incorrect answers are acknowledged with a simple statement to the user, and correct answers receive a short flash of green on some of the screen items.Scoring is calculated by awarding one point for answers less than ten and two points for double digit answers. Misses are counted and displayed as well, but score and misses reset with each game.I hope you enjoy this simple game and challenge your friends and family. Everyone can use a little practice!P.S. Developers, If you improve my design, which I am sure many can, and incorporate the individual digit entry, at least give me credit for the idea. Thanks.

Voix et textes en FRANCAIS.[Jeu complet / Garantie sans virus et sans aucune publicit\u00e9  / vous pouvez tester ce jeu dans sa version gratuite]Ces 3 jeux, destin\u00e9s aux enfants \u00e0 partir de 3 ans, ont la particularit\u00e9 de rendre l'enfant compl\u00e8tement autonome dans son apprentissage, m\u00eame s'il ne sait pas lire, car il est uniquement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de symboles simples, et les instructions sont lues clairement (n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir du son). Ce jeu \u00e9ducatif est enti\u00e8rement en fran\u00e7ais (textes et voix).Il y a trois modes de jeux \u00e9ducatifs :- un jeu de calcul : d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s ludique et interactive, l'enfant va chercher combien il y a de fruits. Il va s'amuser \u00e0 d\u00e9placer les fruits avec son doigt, pour voir s'il n'y aurait pas de fruits cach\u00e9s. Il devra ensuite les compter et valider sa r\u00e9ponse.- un jeu de diff\u00e9rences : une quinzaine de jeux de diff\u00e9rences vont permettre \u00e0 l'enfant d'aiguiser son sens de l'observation. Il va devoir trouver les diff\u00e9rences entre deux dessins, a priori similaires. A chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment trouv\u00e9, un petit d\u00e9compte lui permet de savoir combien il lui en reste \u00e0 trouver. - un jeu de reproduction : les fruits teintent dans un ordre pr\u00e9cis, et l'enfant devra ensuite reproduire l'ordre de ces fruits. C'est sa concentration et sa m\u00e9moire imm\u00e9diate qui seront \u00e9norm\u00e9ment stimul\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s amusante. Une musique tr\u00e8s douce accompagne l\u2019enfant dans son exercice, et \u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019il r\u00e9pond juste, il est encourag\u00e9 dans ses efforts par des applaudissements, un rire, et des \"bravo\".L\u2019interface a \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement con\u00e7ue pour les enfants. Le style graphique est doux et color\u00e9. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'interface se d\u00e9tachent de l\u2019\u00e9cran de mani\u00e8re vive pour \u00eatre bien identifi\u00e9s par l'enfant. Ce jeu permettra \u00e0 votre enfant d\u2019apprendre, tout en s\u2019amusant, \u00e0 aiguiser son sens de l'observation, et \u00e0 s'initier au calcul... et surtout, il passera un tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able moment. L'enfant est compl\u00e8tement autonome devant ce jeu, car toutes les consignes sont (en fran\u00e7ais) tr\u00e8s clairement. La musique est tr\u00e8s douce, et va accompagner l'enfant avec calme dans son jeu. Chaque mini-jeu \u00e9volue progressivement./* Si vous constatez un \"bug\", n'h\u00e9sitez surtout pas \u00e0 m'envoyer un mail : r\u00e9ponse assur\u00e9e *//* les mots d'encouragements sont aussi tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s */Pour l\u2019anecdote, tous mes jeux \u00e9ducatifs sont \"valid\u00e9s\" par ma fille de 3 ans et demi (tr\u00e8s important, le \"demi\"). Et croyez-moi, ma fille est tr\u00e8s \"directe\" (pour ne pas dire \"sans piti\u00e9\")... et je ne mets sur le Store que les jeux qui ont pass\u00e9 sa \"validation\"... Ce quatri\u00e8me jeu est beaucoup plus complet que les 3 autres, et beaucoup plus riches. Les interactions sont plus nombreuses. Educational games (4) for children 4 to 10 years. Voices and texts in FRENCH.[Complete set / warranty free of virus and no advertising / you can test the game in its free version]These three games, for children from 3 years, have the distinction of making the child completely autonomous in their learning, even if he can not read because it is only made from simple symbols and instructions are read clearly (need sound). This educational game is entirely in French (text and voice).There are three modes of educational games:- A set of calculation: a very fun and interactive way, the child will look how many fruits. It'll be fun to move the fruit with his finger to see if there would be no hidden fruit. It will then count and validate its response.- A set of differences fifteen games differences will allow the child to sharpen his sense of observation. He will have to find the differences between two pictures, similar in principle. Each element found a small settlement lets him know how much it remains to find.- A set of reproduction: fruits tinged in a specific order, and the child will then reproduce the sequence of these fruits. This is its concentration and short term memory that will greatly stimulated a very amusing.A very soft music accompanies the child in the exercise, and every time he just answers, it is encouraged in its efforts with applause, laughter, and \"congratulations\".The interface has been specifically designed for children. The graphic style is soft and colorful. The interface elements are detached from the screen so bright to be clearly identified by the child. This game will help your child to learn while having fun, sharpening his sense of observation, and to initiate the calculation ... and most importantly, he spent a very pleasant time. The child is completely self before the game, because all the instructions are (in French) very clearly. The music is very soft, and will accompany the child calmly in his gameEach mini-game is gradually changing./ * If you see a \"bug\", do not hesitate to send me an email: * guaranteed response // * The words of encouragement are also very much appreciated * /For the record, all my educational games are \"validated\" by my 3 year old daughter and a half (very important, the \"half\"). And believe me, my daughter is very \"direct\" (not to say \"no mercy\") ... and I put on the Store that games that have passed its \"validation\" ... The fourth game is much more complete than the other 3, and much richer. Interactions are more numerous.

Players attempt to maneuver their way around the board, answering questions and collecting points. Each correct answer yields points so that the player may enhance his grade. Upon reaching a B grade (7000 points), bridges will open allowing access to the outer area of the board. Here, the player will encounter slightly more challenging questions in an attempt to obtain the 4 keys to unlock the chest and end the game! In the quest for a higher score, players will be able to obtain special cards with powers to increase their movements, eliminate wrong answers and more!

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Hatten+Education", "Description": " Bobbopp is a language game app for young children. In the app you follow a Babbelers\u2019 character - \u201dBobbo\u201d walks, swims and flies around The Babbelers\u2019 Valley to collect things with the \"right sound\" to put in Bobbo\u2019s hat. Can you guess which sounds Bobbo likes? Can you jump over rocks? Did you know that Bobbo loves Bobbleberries? They grow on bushes in the valley. The things you collect turn into pearls, and you can make a colourful \"song necklace\" with them \u2013 look into the hat and you'll see! Once you\u2019ve finished with your pearl necklace you can listen to two different songs that Bobbo sings. (Sing-along, you\u2019ll probably know the tunes...) If you\u2019re missing any pearls then go out into the valley and collect what you need. When you take a thing with the \u201dright\u201d sound you get a reward, you also get a reward if you don\u2019t take things that have the\"wrong sound\", in both cases you will be rewarded with a glittering pearl that you can also collect in the hat. Do you see the movie theatre over there on the hill? Click on it if you want to take a break from collecting things and look at a music video instead. The fun and catchy music video \"First Song\" is showing \u2013 in a way that you have never seen it! Before the video starts, or while it is playing, you can choose the type of weather, if it\u2019s day or night, whether The Babbelers have hats on or not, how the fireworks should look \u2013 or maybe you want Toot to spray bubbles? You\u2019ll be the one who controls the content of the video.When the app starts, you choose whether you want to control it with your voice (choose the mouth icon) or your finger (choose the hand icon). Tip! If you want to play using your voice it is a good idea to sit in a really quiet room without any disturbing noises. One more tip! In the settings (on the app's homepage) you can set how sensitive you want your device\u2019s microphone to be - so you can always speak at just the right level whenever you play. Bobbopp is a simple app for small children, with easy tasks and only a bit to think about \u2013 and The Babbelers\u2019 wonderfully catchy music of course. Bobbo moves slowly, if you want to speed up simply touch your finger to the screen at the bottom and Bobbo will go faster. Bobbopp contains songs with lyrics in English, German and Swedish. Spending time with The Babbelers is a great way for children to get started with sound and speech. The app trains the child to listen carefully and to choose things based on how they sound. Tip! If you really want the child to listen and train their speech it's a good idea to use headphones. The app has a child lock, naturally, so that only adults can open the settings and view information about the app. The app does not include promotions, advertising or further sales in the form of \"InAppPurchases\". Support If you are having problems with the app or you have any questions, please visit our support page \u2013 you will also find a simple contact form there, so you can easily get answers to your questions.

This is a simple math game - my first Android application developed which provided for Kristianstad University and published on Google Play.The game objective is to initially add two numbers together with the goal of reaching the 10thOnce you manage to reach the total 10, you earn 1 point. When reached 6 points becomes severity Moderate available that involves subtraction instead of addition when selected - this is also m\u00e5l-talet/differensen one should aim to reach changed from 10 in force for addition - to 47. Then, to make available the last difficulty level needed 12 points or more, and this level will then cover multiplication instead where the goal instead is to get the product 36.Inside the game on each difficulty level is where so-called \"Eastereggs\" or Easter eggs in Swedish, hidden as when unlocking can provide valuable tips to earn more points in the game.The game I think could be suitable for elementary school students or children and young people interested in mathematics that are just beginning to learn what mathematics is well with any type of introduction to Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication.The application also has the ability to play background music which was donated and created by; andreolssson@hotmail.com - Many thanks for this contribution! :)To reach me who created the application, please feel free to contact me at webtech_solutions@hotmail.se.
