Effective spelling methods do not rely on rote memorization, but are developmentally appropriate and hands-on. Word Study is a widely research-based spelling approach whose purpose is to \u201cexamine words in order to reveal the logic and consistencies within [the] written language system and to help student achieve mastery in recognizing, spelling, and defining specific words\u201d (Words Their Way, Bear, et. al, 2012). Word Study is developmentally appropriate because it takes into consideration what the student understands or does not yet understand about spellings and word meanings to discover where spelling instruction should start. This is accomplished by looking at the student\u2019s misspellings of certain word patterns (from simple words like man to more complex words such as multitude). It is hands-on in that it requires students to analyze, manipulate, and create meaningful and logical generalizations of how word spellings work. Short Vowels Word Study app is based on the Word Study approach described above and is for students in the late Letter Name-Alphabetic Spellers to early Within Word Pattern Spellers, according to the spelling development levels of Words Their Way.Short Vowels Word Study helps kids learn the spelling patterns related to word families and short vowel words through developmentally appropriate and hands-on spelling activities.Short Vowels Word Study teaches kids who are ready for:>  word families,>  short vowel words (CVC), and>  longer short vowel words with blends and diagraphs (CCVC and CVCC)SPELLING ACTIVITIES:SORT IT  -  Sorting words based on their spelling pattern.FIND IT  -  Analyzing words based on their patterns and finding the one that does not fit based on its phonics sound or visual pattern.SPELL IT  -  Manipulating letter tiles to spell short vowel words.WRITE IT  -  Spelling short vowel words by tracing and writing the word.Short Vowels Word Study Bonus Sections:-  a parent section that explains the theory behind the spelling activities included in the app-  a \u201cWord Fun\u201d section, where kids can play spelling games after earning stars from their spelling activitiesNo Adds or In-App purchases!To read more about teaching kids to spell through a developmental approach to spelling, visit This Reading Mama or purchase her book, Teaching Kids to Spell.http://thisreadingmama.com/http://thisreadingmama.com/teaching-kids-to-spell/  ", "content_rating": "Everyone", "reviewers": "0", "operating_system": "2.3.3 and up", "developer": "Out Of Touch Productions", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.thisreadingmama.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE0Nd3RhL4L94HRqgxxo8iijCijQg", "title": "Short Vowel Word Study", "email": "quikclosepro@gmail.com", "rating": "0", "date_published": "September 16, 2014", "category": "Educational", "downloads": "10 - 50", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Out+Of+Touch+Productions"}
