Helps you figure out what you can safely spend right now, and all you have to enter is your current balance. Drop your tedious cashbook app and find out how easy it is to be in control of your budget!What do I get out of it?With True-Budget, you make smarter decisions about your money because you know how much you can safely spend today. You won't hit rock bottom again, and bouncing checks are a thing of the past. How does that work?It's this easy:1. Enter your current balance2. Find out how much you can spend today3. Never worry about running out of money againWhat does the app do?True-Budget calculates where your balance is headed, based on your fixed incomes and expenses. It translates that into a budget for today. It also shows you which expenses are coming up soon.Is it useful for me?If you've been trying to record all your daily expenses, and it hasn't helped you control your budget, then True-Budget is the app for you. Don't focus on what you spent in the past: let True-Budget calculate what you can safely spend today and tomorrow.Does it support my bank?Yes. All banks are good, because True-Budget does not connect to your account. So: no logins, no connection problems, no privacy issues. The only data this app needs is your recurring incomes and expenses. You only enter those once.Is it really free?Yes. If you have one income, and up to ten recurring expenses, and all of those are monthly and without a start or end, then True-Budget is entirely free. We only ask a price for the special features: those were hardest to develop, and they offer you the biggest benefits.What are the paid features?True-Budget really proves its worth if you have multiple incomes, many expenses, non-monthly patterns, one-off expenses, and items that only apply for a few weeks or months. These are the premium features that cost either $1 or $2. For a full list, scroll down to the bottom.Can I reserve money with this app?Yes, we've designed some premium features that help you stay away from rock bottom: you can tell True-Budget to plan for a minimum balance that's higher than zero; you can tell it to reserve a 'petty cash' amount for every day up to your next income.What if my incomes and expenses change a lot? We have one very special feature that projects your balance over a year into the future, so it can see if there are unexpected deficits coming up. If it finds them, it corrects your true budget so that you basically start saving today to stay out of trouble. Is this app for everyone?No. You need to have regular income and regular expenses, True-Budget does not balance your checkbook or let you record today's expenses. Warning to freelancers: you're better off using another app. Try \"Your Daily Budget 2\".What are the alternatives?There are many cashbook apps for Android. Solid ones are EasyMoney, Easy Envelope, Expense Manager, Money Lover, and Cashbook. These apps allow you to enter your expenses, so that you can keep track of them.Why does True-Budget not work that way?Keeping track of your expenses teaches you about the past. Okay, sure. But that won't help you make smart decisions for today and tomorrow. We believe that where you are heading is more important than where you came from.$ 2,- features + feature: Multiple incomes+ feature package: --- Advanced periods: every week / two weeks / four weeks--- Advanced periods: every month / two months / quartlery--- Advanced periods: once-only / yearly / twice a year--- Start and end dates$1,- features + feature: Prevent deficits over a year into the futrue+ feature package:--- Add unlimited expenses (free limit is 10 expenses)--- Set minimum balance --- Daily spending  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mappingtheforest.truebudget", "price": "0", "date_published": "February 11, 2014", "email": "support@true-budget.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "category": "Finance", "developer": "Wytze Schouten", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.3.3 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.true-budget.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFKjNkFUryH6X6DbdsA5qJm-a4Fxg", "reviewers": "499"}

{"title": "Account Manager", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Nagaradjane", "rating": "5", "Description": " This APP is transaction based.SELECTING RIGHT TRANSACTION TYPE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROPER ACCOUNTING USING THIS APP. To initialize the account: use CASH AT HAND to set the liquid money in your possession. Use BALANCE to initialize each account holding your money (bank, debtor, creditor etc.). Use ASSET to initialize the asset count and value in your possession.The transaction types INCOME and EXPENSE are self explanatory.BALANCE ADDED is the transaction type used to increase the balance amount of any head of account. Each BALANCE ADDED transaction reduces the cash at hand by the same amount as the deposit made to the account.  This transaction is used for deposit in bank or lending to a person. BALANCE DIMINISHED is the transaction type used for Withdrawal from bank account.  The same is the transaction type used for receiving money from somebody as a payment for or as loan. This transaction increases cash at hand and reduces the balance position of the respective head of account. ASSET ADDED is the transaction type used for acquiring new asset or property.  It reduces cash at hand and increases the asset value by the same amount.  This transaction requires the number of items (count)  acquired through the transaction. ASSET DISPOSED is the transaction used for selling a property.  This transaction takes the count of items disposed.  It reduces the number of asset items,  reduces the value of asset belonging to the particular head of account and increases the cash at hand. These nine types of transactions constitute the basic requirements of healthy accounting through the AccountManager app. Some transactions require double entries.  Following are the typical situations requiring double transaction entries:1) Bill paid from an account -  requires one BALANCE DIMISHED (bank account or credit card account)  and one EXPENSE transaction with the same amount value but different head of account. 2) Fund transferred from one account to another -  requires one BALANCE DIMINISHED (source account) and a BALANCE ADDED (destination account).  Both transactions have identical money value. 3) Purchase of property from an account -  one BALANCE DIMINISHED transaction followed by another ASSET ADDED transaction. 4) Salary deposited in account -  one INCOME transaction and another BALANCE ADDED transaction. 5) Interest/Dividend received -  one INCOME transaction followed by another BALANCE ADDED transaction. 6) For purchase of a property from an account -  one BALANCE DIMINISHED transaction followed by an ASSET ADDED transaction. 7) For selling a property and getting the proceeds in a bank account -  one ASSET DISPOSED transaction followed by one BALANCE ADDED transaction. For other situations,  suitably conjure up the transaction combinations. Description is anything meaningful to remember the purpose of the transaction,  similar to the remarks made in bank transactions. It helps to clarify the situation. Head of account is the name provided for grouping the expense, income,  balance or asset types in easily identifiable heads of account. The amount entered in the amount column is the transaction value. Any mistakes made in transaction entry may be corrected by pressing Review Transaction button. It fetches a list of items.  Click the wrong transaction.  A separate dialog opens to permit editing of the values.  Pressing I date button saves the changes.  Pressing Delete button deletes that particular record from the database. I should be happy ro receive suggestions regarding the app.Pressing Export button creates text file containing all the transactions and permits sharing of the same over any available means. This file can be sent to another device or computer,  copied to the clipboard and then imported into account manager. Pressing Import button acquires transaction entries from the clipboard.  The entries required should have been copied to the clipboard. Carry your net worth wherever you go!

And the good news is this: you can also join me. This is what I plan. I plan to start with $300 only and double this amount every month. Do the maths. You just need 12 steps to convert this amount into a sum of  more than a million. At every step you will be doubling the lot size. Now an important thing about entry. We will always enter a new swing on a retracement. If you had read my first post, I had explained in detail the Elliott Wave Principle. There is always a corrective wave after the first impulse wave meaning there is always a retracement after the first move. This retracement serves two purposes. It confirms the divergence signal plus you can get as close as possible to the swing high or the swing low to make an entry. This is precisely what we will be doing. Expect something like 1-2 signals every month. These will be sufficient to double the account. Even if you download this APP after a few months, don't worry. Just join us! You will be getting the signals. You just need to double your account for 12 months to reach your goal of a million.

{"title": "Bank SMS", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=HandWallet+Expense+Manager", "rating": "4.210526466369629", "Description": " Bank SMS is a small free app that receives the SMS and notifications from your bank or credit card company and store them in HandWallet.In order to use this app you MUST install first HandWallet - a free professional expense manager that helps you to control your expense, accounts, bills and budget.After installing \"HandWallet\" and \"Bank SMS\" teach the app how to recognize any SMS that you receive from your bank or credit card company. Mark the date of the purchase, amount, payee and any other information that may change in the SMS structure. From this moment any SMS you receive with the same format will create automatically a transaction (\"Action\") inside HandWallet Expense Manager.You can later classify these transactions, view statistics and graphs about them, add details like pictures or remarks and combine them with information from other sources. Why to use Bank SMS ?Bank SMS is the most secured, automated and easy way to manage your expense:1. Collecting the SMS from your bank and credit card company will help you to manage all your expense and financial transactions in one place. By doing so will be able to see the complete picture of all your financial activities without the need to use several apps: one from your bank, one for each credit card company you work with and one for cash transactions.2. By using Bank SMS you don't need to type anymore! All the information is entered automatically (if included in the SMS).3. The data is located ONLY on your phone or tablet. You do not need to rely on 3rd party companies like Mint, Quicken or Yodlee. You DO NOT need to be concerned from privacy issues and you will never receive any \"commercial offers\" from companies that get the information from the bank for you. Work directly with your bank or credit card company without any \"company in the middle\" 4. You do not need to enter your private identification details (user name, password, account number etc).5. \"Online\" has never been so immediate.

{"title": "Coller Institute PE Findings", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Apptasy,+LLC", "rating": "2.6666667461395264", "Description": " Private Equity Findings is a bi-annual 28-page publication issued by the Coller Institute of Private Equity (www.collerinstitute.com) that extracts the key findings from the best of the world\u2019s private equity academic research and brings them to a wider and non-academic audience: the general partners (GPs), limited partners (LPs), advisers and policy makers. The publication, launched in November 2009, presents the research findings in a lively and engaging format through interviews with the authors of the research as well as gathering the insight and opinions of GPs, LPs and advisers. The tone of the pieces is entirely accessible, while remaining authoritative and intellectually rigorous. Findings is not intended to be a pr\u00e9cis of the research showcased, but seeks to stimulate debate and provide informed opinion of issues that are key to the private equity industry and its stakeholders. Findings features research on a range of topics affecting the industry, including buyout performance, networks in venture capital, sovereign wealth funds, governance structures, PE\u2019s effect on employment, GP incentives, captive funds, leverage and regulation.

They are a consequence of growing international shareholding and trade and are particularly important for companies that have dealings in several countries. They are progressively replacing the many different national accounting standards. The rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external.IFRS began as an attempt to harmonize accounting across the European Union but the value of harmonization quickly made the concept attractive around the world. They are sometimes still called by the original name of International Accounting Standards (IAS). IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). On 1 April 2001, the new International Accounting Standards Board(IASB) took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards. During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and Standing Interpretations Committee standards (SICs). The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards International Financial Reporting Standards.IFRS authorize three basic accounting models:I. Current Cost Accounting, under Physical Capital Maintenance at all levels of inflation and deflation under the Historical Cost paradigm as well as the Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power paradigm. (See the Conceptual Framework, Par. 4.59 (b).)II. Financial Capital Maintenance in Nominal Monetary Units, i.e., globally implemented Historical cost accounting during low inflation and deflation only under the traditional Historical Cost paradigm.

The interface is very user-friendly.The platform also provides a special facility for the new traders, i.e,. Demo accounts. The traders are required to make a deposit of $250 to use the facility of demo account. The demo account is a very useful feature provided by this platform as the traders who want to learn and practice trading without putting any money at stake in the very beginning. The Demo accounts are rich in every feature that a regular account has. The money used for the trading purposes in these accounts is imaginary. The traders can make use of many useful tools so that they can polish their skills. The brokers also pay much attention towards these demo accounts, which shows the level of dedication they have towards the betterment of the traders.So, this was all about the Windsor Brokers Review.

You made the sale\u2026 and is that all? Not at all; it is an error to consider that a customer is only worth the profit you get from that one sale. Have you considered this customer could be repeated and then buying again from you? Yeah!In fact, the type of customers we like are those that buy (and pay), and repeatedly in time will be buying again and again. However, no love story has been forever, and your customer will end up buying elsewhere (at least, the average customer will do); do not take it personal, but there are many reasons that this will happen, and marketers should know at which rate your business loses customers (i.e. Fidelity, retention).If you consider this cycle, you are capable of calculating the average profit per customer _which includes the fixed initial acquisition cost (how much have you spent to gain that customer)_ and estimate the average customer life (as your customer), then you should be able to calculate how much a customer is worth to your business: the customer lifetime value (CLV).This app will allow you to calculate CLV the simpler way; when the sales cycle is not too complicated you can approximate the CLV calculation by using the 'turnover', 'number of customers', and 'churn rate' (% of customers that stop buying from you every month).

When using MyWB consistently, it is easy to stay within your means because you are being updated on your spending each time you buy something. This App is easy to use and easy to understand. It is SIMPLE but powerful. First, set yourself a weekly budget target. Then enter your spending with a uniquely simple, straight forward interface and instantly see whether you are meeting your budget. MyWB also shows you how much of your set budget you have at any given day of the week. The goal of this App is to help you control your spending with minimal effort. The App is flexible enough to allow you to customize features to match your needs. There is also a quick and easy way to flick through your spending patterns from previous weeks - so you can get a clear view of where you have been spending your money. At the end of each week, a brief summary for the week is presented showing how well (or badly?!) you have done against your target. Any money not spent may be carried over to the next week, so you can reward yourself with higher spending next week! Any money you received (birthday presents, cash-back on a pair of shoes you returned etc.) may also be added to your current week's spending plan if you choose. MyWB supports your local currency and several other international currencies. You can show the date format to your liking, organize spending in categories as broad or as focused as you want, and includes the option to make your own categories to show personalized descriptions of your spending. You can also export your spending information from MyWB by email so you can use it in other applications on your computer. Do you find money slipping through your fingers?

{"title": "Forex Dashboard", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Andrea+Salvatore+IU4APC", "rating": "4.142857074737549", "Description": " The Forex Dashboard App is the ultimate currency strength/weakness app indicator.It monitors the status of the 8 major currencies (also Gold and Oil) in real time using the data coming from 6 different time frames: from as short as 15 minutes up to a month of data.Why Use Forex Dashboard App?This will give you, not only an overview of the currency situation, but also details on how it is performing in the short term as well.The strength/weakness score goes from -100 to 100 and is calculated using all the pairs in which the currency is involved in. So when for example you see a strong EUR and a weak USD, it means that EUR is strong vs all the other currencies and that the USD is weak versus all the other currencies. This information makes a Long (buy) trade on EURUSD much more interesting.By analysing the single currencies, the Forex Dashboard App will help you choose the best pairs to trade.Simply take the currency or the currencies that are stronger and match with those that are weaker.You can easily spot them as the stronger ones have green histograms while the weaker ones are red.Also, when the score is greater than 80 or lower than -80, the text label of the period becomes green or red accordingly.This can be an interesting entry signal... or at least the first half of it. Now, to be sure, you need another pair that in the same time frame is giving the opposite signal. At this point you can enter a Long (buy) OR Short (sell) trade on that pair.Depending on the time frame, you should have different targets ranging from a few pips to whatever works best on the time frame you are trading. It can be that easy!How To Trade With The Forex Dashboard App?You can trade the Forex Dashboard App on its own by using the signals described above, or (even better) integrate it into your trading system and it'll help you in your trading decisions. The strength and weakness of two currencies can easily help you understand the trend of a pair. From the long term to the short term. Remember... the trend is your friend and the best trends come when there is a divergence between two currencies, i.e. when one is strong and the other is weak.How Does Forex Dashboard App Work?The Forex Dashboard App algorithm works by analysing pure price action. It doesn't use any other indicator like moving averages, RSI, etc.So all the signals are in real time and not lagging. You'll also get to notice how currencies are correlated. You'll get to notice what it means to have a strong Yen, a strong US Dollar or a strong Euro. You'll be able to pick up interesting intermarket correlations with having Gold and Oil displayed, which can assist you in predicting the market. Forex Dashboard App is an all in one app indicator!IMPORTANT:- Remember that the Forex Market is open between Sunday night at around 10PM UT up to Friday night at the about the same time. So, during the weekend, currency scores won't change.- The Forex Dashboard App uses data coming from the Internet so please check you have enough credit if used on mobile networks!Info: info@pimpmyea.comSupport: support@pimpmyea.comhttp://PimpMyEA.com  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pimpmyea.forexdashboard", "price": "EGP19.23", "date_published": "April 25, 2014", "email": "info@pimpmyea.com", "downloads": "100 - 500", "category": "Finance", "developer": "Andrea Salvatore IU4APC", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "1.6 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.pimpmyea.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFlYgr8cj1j5M0k7NYdcc9cY_SUnw", "reviewers": "7"}

This is not just an ordinary calculator. It is an adding machine with tape. Have you ever accidentally cleared your calculator after adding several numbers then forgot what the last total was? Worry no more! With this adding machine your entries will be recorded on tape so you can always look back. So what can you do with an adding machine? Anything that requires adding numbers such as:* balancing your checkbook register* calculating a quote for a client* grocery shopping (need to stay within a budget?)* totaling game scores like Scrabble and Yahtzee* ...and anything else that needs some adding!A standard calculator just doesn't cut it when you are dealing with several numbers. When you make a mistake you have to start over from the beginning. With an adding machine you can look at the tape to find your mistake then quickly fix it.Features include:+resizable buttons!+added the option for inserting commas for every thousand i.e. \"1000.00\" is displayed as \"1,000.00\"+print receipts via Google Cloud Print+copy and paste across apps (long press values on the tape or display for copy and paste)+swipe across the tape to tear it instead of long pressing+export receipt to CSV file (location on SD card: \"AddingMachine/export/\")+ send plain text receipts via text, email, etc+ save/load receipts+ view saved receipts+ tear the tape (swipe tape left or right)+ set number of decimals+decimal lock - long press the decimal point to lock it so that you do not have to press it every time i.e. if you type \"199\" it becomes \"1.99\" (decimal point turns red when locked)+ set tax rateIt works just like a real adding machine.

The real time spot FX rates are supplied by Forex.com.  Upper and lower limits can be set-up whilst \u2018at a glance\u2019 icons will allow you to quickly see where current prices are in relation to your set limits.The Spot Forex widget displays your chosen currency pair with the current bid/offer prices plus movement indicators to show up/down (or no change) movement since the last refresh.  The refresh rate can be set between 5 and 60 seconds.The Spot Forex widget has three touch sensitive areas:1. the Smartphonet \u2018S\u2019 logo - for limits2. the currency pair/prices  - to set up or change your currency pair3. the revolve sign  - to reverse the current pair/display the inverse rateThe options can either be accessed via the notification bar icon (which runs on widget setup or change), through the limits input screen, or from the Alert app in your main apps menu.Available options are:Show popups - where currency rates are shown in a screen popup, at your chosen refresh period, on any screen in any application. This can be toggled on/off.Vibrate settings - to set a vibrate warning on breach of your pre-set limits.  This can be set to vibrate once, on breach, or on each refresh whilst the limit remains brokenWidget background - light/dark solid, or translucent, backgrounds are available for the clearest view depending on your personal preferences or desktop background.The currency setup screen (touch the currency pair) has a list of available currency pairs in alphabetical order.  The yellow column on the right provides a shortcut to all the pairs associated with each individual currency so a couple of touches on this selection screen should be sufficient for any available currency pair.To set the limits (touch the Smartphonet logo on the widget) you need to enter an upper limit for the value of the ask price and a lower limit for the bid price. Percentages create a rate range (the zone of interest) calculated, using the set limit/percentage, below the ask price and above the bid price.The notification icons on the widget work as follows:Blank smiley - no limits entered, left = lower limit, right = upper limitHappy smiley - limits entered but current rates have not brkoen the limit, or entered the zone of interest.Unhappy smiley - current rates have entered the zone of interestRed barred circle - limits broken (with optional vibrate warning)Smartphonet\u2019s Alert: Spot Forex uses either 3G or wifi to communicate with the Smartphonet web service and if communication has stopped/is unavailable the revolve icon changes to a globe with a red cross.  As soon as a connection is re-established the revolve icon returns.If you need a short User Guide please email the contact address shown below.

They are a consequence of growing international shareholding and trade and are particularly important for companies that have dealings in several countries. They are progressively replacing the many different national accounting standards. The rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external.IFRS began as an attempt to harmonize accounting across the European Union but the value of harmonization quickly made the concept attractive around the world. They are sometimes still called by the original name of International Accounting Standards (IAS). IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). On 1 April 2001, the new International Accounting Standards Board(IASB) took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards. During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and Standing Interpretations Committee standards (SICs). The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards International Financial Reporting Standards.IFRS authorize three basic accounting models:I. Current Cost Accounting, under Physical Capital Maintenance at all levels of inflation and deflation under the Historical Cost paradigm as well as the Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power paradigm. (See the Conceptual Framework, Par. 4.59 (b).)II. Financial Capital Maintenance in Nominal Monetary Units, i.e., globally implemented Historical cost accounting during low inflation and deflation only under the traditional Historical Cost paradigm. (See the original Framework (1989), Par 104 (a)) [now Conceptual Framework (2010), Par. 4.59 (a)]III.

This kind of pattern has been described in books such as \"How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market by Nicolas Darvas\", and \"Stan Weinstein, Stan Weinstein's Secrets For Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets\". Channel period of 100, 200 and 400 trading days are screened each day by the app, and breakout is detected when the high volume and high percentage move criteria are met. Usually the longer time frame patterns yields more potential gain, but rare in occurance.Rounding Bottoms:Rouding Bottom is a \"U\" shaped pattern characterized by a descend from a high point to a flat bottom, followed by a sudden breakout usually accompanied by a news or market events, and resulting a prolonged \"rounding up\" uptrend, sometimes even far exceeds the previous high. This is usually a long term pattern with the bottom section lasting more than 100 days. In Screenulator, we scan patterns between 100 to 1000 day time span. It is usually a high profitable pattern, but rare in occurance. There are two Rounding Bottom patterns: RB-Potential and RB-Complete. Because of the rarity of this pattern, Screenulator also screens for potential Rounding Bottom (RB-Potential) patterns which have not reached its the previous high (thus incomplete), but only started the initial breakout. The \"Rounding Bottom Potential\" therefore has more daily qualifiers than \"Rounding Bottom Complete\", and more profit potentials, albeit with less success rate.Quotes and Charts:The app also contains the industry leading charts from Interactive Stock Charts \u2122, with touch info display, scroll, panning, pinch zoom time frame changes. Various TA indicator supports: MACD, RSI, SMA, EMA, Bollinger band, Aroon, Stochastic and others will be added upon request. Intraday 1, 5, 10, 30 minute charts.

The other supported Bitcoin exchanges remain unaffected and trading continues. Update: Added Current Market Prices & Pebble Smartwatch support.Okay folks, many of us have been watching with interest the news stories and Federal rulings surrounding Bitcoin. A few more of you may have noticed that I myself have been trading on the Bitcoin exchanges and while I won't confirm or deny anything, it's widely assumed I have not done too badly swing trading Bitcoin against the US Dollar and back again. Remember, you don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin, you can purchase fractions. The fastest way to purchase is via CoinMama or CoinBase.So I decided to create an Android App to provide folks with the first ever realtime Bitcoin trading signals direct from my own personal one-of-kind trading platform, affectionately known around here as 'JayTrader'. Now I know what you are thinking... why would I release such a thing for everyone. Well, it's already doing okay for me without releasing this app, so I figured if people use it, the signals become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's the age-old supply and demand rule right? More people buy, price goes up, more people sell, price goes down. It's not rocket salad.'Bitcoin Bud' for Android is directly linked to my 'JayTrader' server, which is in turn linked to the major Bitcoin exchanges via their API's for realtime price data. It's like having another trader with you, everytime I make a move on the Bitcoin Markets you will know about it LIVE with a notification on your device.How does it work?The 'JayTrader' platform sits between the major Bitcoin exchanges and the Bitcoin Bud App. This is where I make manual trades, however the JayTrader platform is also powered by an algorithym dubbed the 'JMA' - that is 'Jester Moving Average'. This allows the JayTrader platform to detect market conditions based on technical analysis and then trade automatically while simultaneously pushing out a BUY/SELL signal to people with the Bitcoin Bud App.What is it NOT?Bitcoin Bud is NOT, a Bitcoin wallet or a trading platform. Bitcoin Bud cannot see or know if you made a trade based on a signal. It is there to remove some of the guesswork when dabbling on the Bitcoin markets. It allows you to see what I am doing and when I am doing it realtime. Whether you choose to act on the signals provided is purely your own choice.JayTrader Platform and this app have been designed to assist both seasoned traders and those wishing to get into the Bitcoin fray for the first time.Thanks for listening.

The colors of tiles indicate daily % change, with the brightest GREEN for GAIN, and brightest RED for LOSS. The border thickness and color indicate your holding values and if it is long or short position. Performance bar at the baseline indicate your holding performance with respect to purchase / short price. Much of these can be customized to your individual style. The list view is also available if that is your preference.The tiles can be sorted by daily % change, alphabetical, time added, holding value, holding performance. Other sorting order based on technical and fundamental indicators can be added upon request!You will immediately know which stock in your portfolio or watchlist is gaining the most or suffering losses simply based on the colors. As well, the overall market performance can be felt with the overall colors of the tiles collection.

You can use them to pay anyone who has a remote deposit feature on their bank, including smartphone apps with camera deposit, or direct banking accounts that let you upload check images to the web.The app does not connect to the internet, and no third party account is required, so your confidential payment information remains safe.The checks are generated using the United States standard for check formatting.  All you need is a blank check, or your account information from your bank.  Enter the information into Light Check, including the account holder's name and address, and the routing and account numbers.  Then draft a check for a certain amount to a recipient and sign the check.   Saving specific account information is optional, and no information ever leaves your device, except to your trusted payment recipients.For visual payment in person, 7\" and 10\" high resolution tablets work best.  For devices above 7\", a screen pixel density of more than 120 ppi is recommended.

{"title": "My Cashflow & Budget", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Jemstone+Consulting", "rating": "5", "Description": " My Cashflow is a financial analysis and budgeting app that allows you to analyse what you earn and where you spend it, and to create models to predict how your financial position will be affected by upcoming purchasing decisions.To analyse your actual income and expenses, you simply download bank account and credit card statements from your internet banking site, drop the OFX file into a folder, and My Cashflow will automatically assign each transaction to a user defined category. This is done by applying rules (that you define) that match key words in the transaction descriptions to a category. The special algorithms in My Cashflow enable it to categorise thousands of transactions in just a few seconds, even with over 100 rules.To predict your future financial position, you create a scenario that contains all budgeted income and expense items, along with opening balances for each account. Each transaction can be repeating and is allocated to an account and a category. My Cashflow then creates a cashflow forecast for each account, with charts and reports that illustrate your overall position.If your bank and credit card statements have been loaded and categorised, the cashflow forecast charts will also show your actual balances on the same chart.You can create any number of scenarios to perform a what-if analysis; what if I buy that TV/car/boat, what if I increase my mortgage payments, what if my salary increases by 5% next year.My Cashflow is fast; cashflow forecasting and transaction indexing operations happen in the background, ensuring that user operations are smooth and uninterrupted.Accounts\u2022 Unlimited accounts\u2022 Multiple account types\u2003\u2022 Current/Cheque Account\u2003\u2022 Deposit Account\u2003\u2022 Credit Card Account\u2003\u2022 Loan/Mortgage Account\u2022 Loan or Mortgage accounts support\u2003\u2022 Amortized loan repayment calculations\u2003\u2022 Including interest rate changes\u2003\u2022 Lump sum repayments\u2003\u2022 Additional drawdowns\u2022 Credit Card accounts support\u2003\u2022 Automatic calculation of payments at end of statement periodCategories\u2022 Unlimited user defined categories\u2022 Each category can be Income, Expense or Either - used for reporting\u2022 Shared by all scenariosTransactions\u2022 Unlimited transactions\u2022 Multiple transaction types\u2003\u2022 Deposit\u2003\u2022 Withdrawal\u2003\u2022 Opening/Closing balances with effective date\u2003\u2022 Interest Paid/Received\u2003\u2022 Transfers between accounts\u2022 Flexible repeat options\u2003\u2022 Daily - every n days\u2003\u2022 Weekly - every n weeks, on a specific day or days of the week\u2003\u2022 Monthly - every n months, on a specific day of the month or on the nth day of the week in the month e.g. on the 3rd Wed every month\u2003\u2022 Yearly - every n years, on a specific day/month\u2022 Transaction Overrides\u2003\u2022 Repeating transactions create multiple items in the cashflow forecast\u2003\u2022 Individual items in the cashflow forecast can be overridden e.g. a monthly electricity bill for $100 can be overridden to $90 for a specific month.\u2003\u2022 An override can have a different amount, date and description\u2022 Interest rates can be set with effective datesScenarios\u2022 Unlimited scenarios\u2022 Each scenario is a separate model; create one for your budget, one for your bank statements\u2022 A scenario is for a specific time period\u2022 A scenario can include other scenarios, inheriting all transactions\u2022 Transactions and cashflow forecasts are contained by a scenarioReports\u2022 Cashflow forecasts for all accounts\u2022 Budget forecast summarizes transactions across all accounts by category and time period\u2022 Transactions by category or account\u2022 All reports support drill-down to the underlying transactions  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jemstone.mycashflow.ui", "price": "EGP12.22", "date_published": "May 17, 2014", "email": "mycashflow@jemstone.co.nz", "downloads": "50 - 100", "category": "Finance", "developer": "Jemstone Consulting", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "3.0 and up", "reviewers": "2"}

It also has a filter or stock screener based on Trendline patterns, such as Resistance breakout and Support penetration. For example, you can see all the stocks that have broke out resistance levels at a glance.About Trendlines:A trend line is a bounding line for the price movement of a security. A support trend line (or a bottom line) is formed when a securities price decreases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous support pivot points. Similarly a resistance trend line (or a top line) is formed when a securities price increases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous resistance pivot points. In other words, bottom lines are formed by joining a series of bottom points, and top lines are formed by joining a series of peaks. Trendlines are considered by many expert traders and investors as the single most important tools in technical analysis. However, unlike other indicators of Technical Analysis, it does not come with a fixed formula, but require human eyes and brain to draw the best fit line across a series of bottoms or tops. It is still very much of an art form. If you are looking for a particular trendline pattern - such as Resistance breakout, the tasks of drawing trendlines for all stocks on the market becomes tedious if not impossible. This tool solves the problem for you.The App lets user select any stock by entering symbol or company name, and shows near real time quotes (synched with Yahoo finance), and draws beautiful candle stick charts with trendlines overlay. Charts can be viewed in many timeframes - from 3 months to 10 years or maximum lifespan of the stock. Trendline overlays are designed to help you find true trendlines, not the final answer. Some possible trendline candidates may not match your ideal shape, use your intuition to make the best trading decision.Stock screeners based on trendline patterns include: Resistance (topline) breakout, Support (bottom line) penetration, Channels (both top and bottom line), Wedge (Consolidation pattern bounded by top and bottom lines), near Support level, near Resistance level.

{"title": "iMoney Freedom", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Giovanni+Accetta", "rating": "0", "Description": " iMoney Freedom presents a powerful, comprehensive, and intuitive system designed to help you keep control of your financial life. Oversee your account balances, track your income and spending, keep budgets, and have your data synced among your iPhone and iPad via iCloud. Do it all in a straightforward and stylish interface.Easier than Ever! Finally, the Money Management made simple! Here's the easiest and most effective money management system to help you achieve your financial freedom! With iMoney Freedom you have at your disposal:* Jars or accounts: teach you money management in a simple and functional way (to teach your mind to create wealth). It is based on the division of monthly income in six different accounts (jars) for six different purposes, and the most important thing is to create a habit and daily attention to our goal of becoming financially free. How it works? For every dollar you earn after taxes, you sort it in the following six \u201cjars\u201d (or bank accounts), labeled as follows: 1. Freedom Jar (10%) 2. Saving Jar (10%) 3. Education Jar (10%) 4. Play Jar (10%) 5. Donation Jar (5% \u2013 10%) 6. Living Jar (50% \u2013 55%) The system of jars is very simple, because it expects to train yourself to manage your money so that you can answer all your expenses, even those unforeseen, no wobble financially.Your money will go to feed the different areas of your life. I bet you would not want to be rich without amusement, or rich, ignorant, or too much fun to find you on the streets shortly after. Every area of your life needs to be fed, in the right amount, in the right proportions.* Dream: evolved board for your projects. The dream is divided into two sections: you can insert images of the goals you want to get, tracing also a brief description, and you can also make a detailed map of things to do in order to achieve what you want in your life.* Affirmations: here you can enter a series of statements that give you power and strength. You can also set a specific time as a reminder or alarm clock so that you can read every day (the incredible power of affirmations!).FEATURES:\u2022 Automatic calculations on your incomes\u2022 Personalize jar percentages \u2022 Personalize jar labels\u2022 Chronology AND YET ... \u2022 Password protection - Insert a pin code. By doing this you will protect your private information\u2022 Automatic backup to Dropbox, Drive \u2022 Backup and restore on Drive, Dropbox \u2022 Exceptional Customer Support.

Point & Figure charts consist of columns of X's and O's that represent filtered price movements. X-Columns represent rising prices and O-Columns represent falling prices. Each price box represents a specific value that price must reach to warrant an X or an O. Time is not a factor in P&F charting. These charts evolve as prices move. No movement in price means no change in the P&F chart. In classic 3-box reversal charts, column reversals are further filtered requiring a 3-box minimum to reverse the current column. The 3-box Reversal Method is the most popular P&F charting method.P&F charts provide a unique look at price action that has several advantages. P&F charts:- Filter insignificant price movements and noise- Focus on important price movements- Remove the time aspect from the analysis process- Make support/resistance levels much easier to identify- Provide automatic and subjective trendlinesI hope that you\u2019ll enjoy this little widget and that it will save you time going through your favorite P&F charts...Please get back to me with some feedback,Regards,cousinHubWaveStock.comCharts are coming from STOCKCHARTS - Copyright \u00a9 2013 STOCKCHARTS.com.

For those users who know the account debits and credits but don't know whether those resulted in increases or decreases, this app will automatically indicate whether the debits and credits resulted in increases or decreases and will prepare the related financial statements.For those users that are visual learners, the app's border turns green when your entries are in balance and turns red when they are out of balance. If you are out of balance, the app allows you to fix it by adjusting any of the entries.  If it turns green, you know you are back in balance.

{"title": "MobileLoan", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Tomasz+Stanczak", "rating": "4", "Description": " MobileLoan Calculator allows you to calculate and manage any loan, including unscheduled repayments, and exchange data with other programs via CSV import/export. The calculator provides a quick overview of the overall cost, the repayment to interest ratio, the impact of inflation on the total debt, as well as a payment plan covering the complete term of the loan. No matter whether you want to finance a car or a house, MobileLoan Calculator will let you evaluate offers or manage existing loans. Try it for yourself!Declaration of independency: we are not dependent on any sponsors, included but not limited to banks, credit institutions or other financial service providers. We do not send any of the calculations or any other data to anybody, give e-mail addresses to anybody away, send unsolicited messages. Calculate:* Loan Amount: if you know how much money you need, or if you want to evaluate the target loan amount you can afford.* Nominal interest: what interest rate is the basis for the finance plan? How much more would be affordable?* Annuity/Payment: how much must you pay for this loan depending on the type of payment? Can you afford it?* Term: how long will you repay this loan under the given conditions?* Residual debt: how much will you still owe by the end of the finance plan?Calculate by using:* Payment method: semi-monthly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, tri-annually, semi-annually and yearly.* Interest method: US (nominal interest rate = relative periodic interest calculation) or ICMA (effective interest rate = compounded periodic interest calculation)* A grace period (period without repayments)* Unscheduled repayments: unlimited, non-recurring and/or recurring, constant or relative to loan values.* Costs: unlimited, non-recurring and/or recurring, including points or account fees, constant or relative to loan values.The clean layout provides an at-a-glance assessment of the economic viability of a loan, helps compare it with alternatives, and allows for easy data entry and management of loan characteristics.History: automatically saves all calculations (customize the number of steps to save). All values are only a click away and instantly reusable.Favorites: unlimited number of predefined calculations for later review and/or edits.Once the calculation is successfully completed, you obtain a finance plan with the complete progression, the effective interest rate, the sum of all payments, plus some additional information, including the amount of residual debt after half of the agreed term, the amount of time left until half the loan is payed back, as well as a graphical view. The impact of inflation on the debt can be simulated.MobileLoan Calculator features PDF and CSV export (with customizable delimiters) via e-mail as well as printing the loan data and payment plan on compatible printers.MobileLoan Calculator was designed based upon recognized financial mathematical rules, and calculates fast and reliably.

With an average turnover in excess of US$4 trillion per day being traded by governments, central banks, financial institutions, corporations and professional and retail traders, foreign exchange is the largest financial market in the world. In comparison, the New York Stock Exchange has a daily turnover of around US$50 billion.Volatility Foreign exchange rates can change rapidly in response to any real-time economic and political events. This offers great opportunities for traders to make profits in the forex markets. Of course, volatility can be a double-edged sword, and losses can accumulate just as quickly. Ability to go long and short Unlike traditional equity markets, forex trading allows you to trade and profit on any price movement up or down. As a forex trader, you can go long (buy) on a currency pair when you expect the first currency will strengthen (appreciate) against the second currency and your profits will rise in line with any increase as the exchange rate goes up. You can also go short (sell) on the currency pair when you expect the first currency will weaken (depreciate) against the second currency and your profits will rise in line with any fall in the exchange rate. Apply now, trade nowApply for a FOREX account at www.fxsol.co.uk.Risk WarningForeign exchange (Forex) and contract for difference (CFD) trading carries a high level of risk to your capital with the possibility of losing more than your initial investment and may not be suitable for all investors. Ensure you fully understand the risks involved and seek independent advice if necessary.

{"Description": " This application allows you to calculate the values \u200b\u200bof a loan, including interest rate.It is always difficult to verify the effective interest rate, because the calculation requires mastery of financial calculator.For example, funding of $ 10,000 in 10 installments of $ 1,100 generates a total of $ 11,000 and an interest \"apparent\" of $ 1,000 or 10%. But the payments are monthly and so the calculation can not be done this way.Interest in the above example would be 10% if $ 11,000 were paid in full at the end of 10 months. But we pay monthly. So the Annual equivalent Rate of this example is about 24%!This application will quickly calculate the interest rate and will also allow the calculation of other factors, if the interest rate is already known.The calculation of the interest rate is always done by approximation, and in this application, we use the Newton-Raphson method. Therefore, depending on the inputed values\u200b\u200b, the calculation may take a few seconds.
