{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Angry+Marmot+Games", "Description": " Dice Wars is turn based board game where you need to capture all cells of map to win. Map is made of hexagons which can have 1-8 dices on them. There are two colors of dices on map Blue (You) and Red (Opponent). You can attack hexagons near your border. To attack opponent you need to select (tap) one of Your hexagons which has more than one dice on it and then tap on opponents hexagon. Dices on hexagons will be rolled and winner is one whose dices have greater sum. If sums are equal than defender wins. Winner takes opponents hexagon by moving his dices to it leaving only one behind. If you lose battle you will lose all dices but one. When you are done with your moves you need to end turn (pressing bottom right button). At the end of each turn you will randomly receive new dices.

One player has the dark pieces, and the other has the light pieces. The players alternate turns. It is against the rules to move one of the opponent's pieces. The player with the light pieces moves first unless stated otherwise. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent piece, it may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it to the unoccupied square immediately beyond it.Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional when presented. In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.Game Rules: * English draughts * Russian draughts * International draughts (8x8)Features:\u00a0* Hard/Medium/Easy level * Point counter  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.first75.checkers2", "category": "Board", "title": "Checkers", "email": "jakub.first@gmail.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "developer": "First75", "price": "0", "rating": "3.5080971717834473", "operating_system": "2.3 and up", "content_rating": "Everyone", "date_published": "August 20, 2014", "reviewers": "494"}

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=GAV+Apps", "Description": " Get the best Mancala game for free. Test your skills against a friend or try our 128 levels where you will meet powerful opponents.Mancala is a very old game that was played in Africa in countries like Syria, Lebanon or Egypt. This game was mentioned first in 6th and 7th century AD and all that players needed was some seeds and a wooden Mancala board.Although it is an ancient game it required intelligence, attention and vision.This board game is also known in different countries or regions with other names like: Woro, Awele (Awale), Oware (Owari), Kboo, Kbo, Ayo, Ayoayo, Kale, Aghi, Bantumi.In America you could find it under the name of Mandink and in Kenya or other countries from Africa as Endoidoi.But by far the most common other names are Kalah and Oware (Owari). And also maybe Awele (Awale) or Ayo and even Wari. All this are names from Africa so the origin of this game must be Africa.It was brought in USA under the name of Kalah and a commercial version became popular in the 1940s. in the West Africa and the Caribbean you could find the name Oware (Owari).Both Kalah and Oware (Owari) represent this board game but maybe with some changes. It is said that Kalah or Oware (Owari) are not a Mancala game but are part of the Mancala familiy board games.Your objective is simple: get more gems ( gold ) than your opponent. So if you collect more gems ( gold ) in your mancala at the end of the game you are the winner.But sometimes is not that simple. There are some rules and strategy that can help you or destroy you.Each player have 6 cups (or different number of cups). Initially each of the cups has the same number of pieces of gold (there is the option where you can have a variable number of pieces of gold) and the opponents will take turns.On each turn you must select one of your cups that contain gems in it and redistribute it's gems clockwise to the next cups. If the last gem that you redistribute lands on your mancala you receive another turn. If the last gem that you redistribute lands on an empty cup from your side you \"steal\" all the gems from your opponent side. The game ends when you or your opponent have/has no pieces of gold in the cups from your or his side.You can play this board game agains a friend or against the computer. You can change the number of gems in each cup (2,3,4 or 5 or variable), the number of places for gems available in the cups and 4 type of difficulty for the computer. Some graphical changes are also posible like the colors of the gems. You also can play in a time limited per round and also change the first one to start (you or the computer).Don't forget to play the quest of this board game. 4 seasons available with 32 levels each. The computer will became stronger as you manage to move forward. He will play more aggressive or more defensive. The number of pieces of gold will change and other interesting things that will make this quest very nice. The second season is time limited so for each turn you will have a limit amount of time to do your move. If you don't make the move you will lose your turn. It gets really complicated at the end when you will only have 3 seconds for your turn. The third season is with a variable number of gems in each cup so the clasic strategy and moves could not be used here. The fourth season is where everything is changed. The numbers of cups, the number of cups holders or gems. This is the most difficult season. Please send feedbacks for improvements and bug fixing to improve this board game.This game is playable on all resolutions and we recommende it on any devices.Have fun!

If internet connection is available, the best move in endgame positions with at most five pieces will be found in an online table base. Internet connection will not be used for any other purpose.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Floydware", "Description": " Quetzal is a board game in which you draw, mimic but mostly, you laugh!Quetzal is inspired by board games like Pictionary and Visual Game, or the mostrecent \"Draw Something\", appropriately revised. More than 4200 words to draw and to mimic and more then 600 Taboo words, costantly updated!***NEW***Now you can play Quetzal in the Taboo way! You can test it during a normal Quetzal game, or unlock the full Taboo mode in App.You can play it everywhere: you only need Quetzal and the Taboo mode (disclaimer: also imagination could be needed).************Compared to these games, however, you don't have to worry about cards, boards and stopwatches, or to take note of the scores: Quetzal does everything!In order to play, you need only Quetzal, paper, pens and a few friends.Create 2 to 4 teams and try to make your teammates guess the words that Quetzal will generate,accumulating points in different game modes.The basic version of Quetzal contains more than 750 words to draw and mimic and to play in Taboo mode, divided into 5 categories:\u272a Items\u272a Animals\u272a Actions\u272a Jobs\u272a AbstractsYou can, however, expand your collection of words by downloading add-on packages, such like Characters or Proverbs, or the expansions of the base packages.This free version of Quetzal contains third parties advertisements. If you liked the game, leave your rating and maybe send us some ideas or some comments.Have fun :)-------------------------------------------------Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Quetzal/623034971075565Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/floydware_dev-------------------------------------------------Tags: quetzal, pictionary, draw, mime, mimic, taboo, draw something, board game, boardgame, pencil, pen, paper, sheet, friends-------------------------------------------------Quetzal's \"Taboo mode\" is not associated with Hasbro's Taboo / Tabou / Tab\u00f9 / Tabuu / Tabo products, registered trademarks.

Hnefatafl is perhaps the best known of the Tafl games played by the Vikings.  It is a deep, strategic game with a fundamentally asymmetric design - players start out in different positions on the board, with different numbers of pieces, and with entirely different victory conditions.  In many respects, it is unique among the games of antiquity.Our version of the game begins with a small band of Vikings surrounded on all four sides by slavering Deep Ones.  The goal of the Vikings is to escape and the goal of the Deep Ones is to capture the Viking leader.While we also offer a board game (check us out on Facebook), the digital version pits players against one another in a turn-based battle between Viking Warlord and Tentacled Monster!

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Lunagames+Fun+%26+Games", "Description": " Help the crazy scientist fixing his equipment. His super computer has gone haywire and you need to figure out what went wrong. It seems that all circuit connections have been dissolved. It is up to you to reconnect the circuit board so that the professor can go back and finish his ridiculous research.Easy to learn hard to master:The task seems easy at first. Players need to connect the conductors so that a current can flow between circuits. The conductors are all colour coded so that is easy enough, but the different colours may not overlap. It is important to plan your circuit connections well in advance as the levels will become increasingly difficult to solve. Drawing the connections:The basics are simple. You draw a line to connect the circuitry. In later levels you will also need to mind the amount of space that is available for your conductors.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Soham+Sengupta", "Description": " Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide in homes, parks, clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with the objective to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a draw in several ways, where neither player wins. The course of the game is divided into three phases: opening, middlegame, and endgame.This is a simple yet intelligent chess game which you will definitely like to play. It's simple in look-and-feel and does not support multiplayer mode in the free version. I am shortly going to publish the premium application which will be equipped with multiplayer mode; and can be played on two different devices over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct and Internet.Till then, why don't you try and enjoy your triumph over your Phone?

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Sascha+Hlusiak", "Description": " This is the Android version of Freebloks 3D, an implementation of the famous board game Blokus. Try to place as many tiles on the board as possible, keeping in mind only two simple rules: your tiles must touch a corner of one of your previously placed tiles, but they must not share an edge. Can you play more tiles than your opponents? RULESEach player has 21 Tetris-like tiles: 12 tiles with 5 squares, 5 tiles with 4 squares, 2 tiles with 3 squares, 1 tile with 2 squares and 1 tile with 1 square. Players take turns in placing one tile onto the 20x20 board. The first tile for each player has to be placed in their corner of the board. Each following tile has to touch a corner of one of your previous tiles, but it must never share an edge. It may share edges with the opponents' tiles though. If a player has no more possible move, they have to pass. The game is over when no player can place a tile. For each player, the squares of all their tiles on the board are added up. Finishing a game with all stones placed on the board gives a 15 points bonus. If the monomino is placed last, you will get a 20 points bonus. The player with the most points  wins. HOW TO PLAY- Swipe the list of available tiles with your finger. - Select and drag a tile onto the board. - Rotate the stone using one of the 4 handles. - To flip a stone, slide your finger from one handle toward the opposing handle.- Place the tile in the desired position. The tile will appear green if the position is valid, and red otherwise. Possible corners are highlighted on the board for convenience. - Tap the tile in a valid position to place it. - You can rotate the board at any time to see the opponents' tiles. Quit the app at any time, your current game will be saved and restored on next start. FEATURES- Supports 2-player modes, with 2 colors (Original and Blokus Duo), 4 colors (2 each).- Customizable board sizes other than 20x20.- Play against the computer or humans on the same device. - Play online against your friends- Hint and undo options- Leaderboards and Achievements (Google+ login required)- Looks great on tablets, too!The game is network-compatible with Freebloks 3D for Windows and Linux: http://www.saschahlusiak.de/freebloks-3d/ PLEASE DONATEFreebloks 3D is absolutely free, open source and without advertisement!

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=App-z.net", "Description": " Pong Ball is a sport in which two players hit a lightweight ball back and forth using a table tennis racket. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, players must allow a ball played toward them only one bounce on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. When doing so the hitter has a good chance of scoring if the spin is successful.

Up to four players can play. The tiles are in four colors (usually red, blue, green and black) with numbers from 1 to 13 over them, as every tile have two numbers. There are two additional tiles (with Star or J over them). The tiles are 106 total. (4 x 13 x 2 = 104 + 2 = 106 ) (2 black 1, 2 black 2, 2 black 3, \u2026\u2026, 2 green 13 etc.). Plus the two tiles with star (called fake OK).Every player has a board for ordering of tiles. The tiles are closed and ordered by five in a heap, one next to the other (21 heaps x 5 pc. + 1)For the determination of the OK cast a die, (2 times - the first time to determinate the heap, and the second time to determinate which tile from the heap will be OK) and then the game is open. The open tile (a number from the respective color), with 1 (bigger from the same color) is OK (for example if the open tile is black 1, OK is black 2 - two pc.). The OK could replace every other tile when making series (groups).DEALING OF THE TILESSomeone of the players deal the tiles, as the first player have 15 tiles (because he is going to play first), and the other three players have 14 tiles each. Every player arranges his tiles on his board. With the arranging, if some player before to play have the same tiles, as the open tile (in the example - black 1), the result of the other player became with one point down (if the player has at least three points). The players are doing that before the end of the first round.GAMEThe player, who have 15 tiles play first. He cleans one tile for which he suppose, that he will not need in the making of the series (groups), as he puts her on his right side (between his desk and the desk of the player, who stands on his right side).The players are making moves counterclockwise. Then plays the second player, who can take the tile, left by the previous player (the player who is on his left side) or to withdraw one tile from the heap in the middle (those tiles, which are not given to the players) and then also cleans one tile. Then plays the third player and after him, the forth player.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Gerhard+Roth", "Description": " This app recognize chess figures (diagrams) in a book or magazine.  It is a free version of ChessOcr https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kgroth.chessocr but instead of using the back facing camera, the input is any captured image in the gallery. This captured image must contain the chess figure and is typically obtained by doing a screen capture of a displayed chess figure (from a pdf file or a web page). The input image can also be captured off-line using any camera, which is then transferred to the Android device. This app can be invoked directly at which point the input picture must be selected. However, if you have an image in the gallery to process (or have a screen capture) then you can also open it and select ChessOcrPict to process this image using the share content icon. Once in ChessOcrPict simply touch the screen to start the recognition process. If recognition is successful it displays the result, and asks you to select which color is to move, which is always necessary. Then it saves each recognized figure in a pgn file, and also puts the most recent one in the clipboard as a FEN string. Once the position is recognized you can do with ChessOcrPict exactly what you could do with ChessOcr.  That is you can invoke an Android chess program like DroidFish, SCIDOnthego or Chess for Android to analyze the position or perform a data base search for games that contain this position (SCIDOnthego). There is a free SCID database that can be used with SCIDOnthego. Simply download the zip file http://www.kgrothapps.com/files/dbsmall-apr-6-13.zip then unzip and put these files in SCID directory.For best results the chess figure should take up at least half of the  input image. If recognition fails then the app simply returns directly without a result. So in summary, this app has the same functionality as ChessOcr, but the input is a static image obtained off-line, and not a live image obtained from a back facing camera. ChessOcrPict does not work well on web pages, but it will work on the pdf files for books and magazines.

This can be achieved by moving your coins from one empty place to the other. The first player to capture all the coins wins the game.The chips can moved  to maximum single distance and 2 positions in case of capture .There are 16 coins with each of the players (total number of coins is 32). All the coins are already placed on the board with the middle space vacant. Each player gets one turn to move the coin. The first player has to start by moving the coin to the vacant space. Once the game begins, the player can move their coin to the empty space or capture the opponent's coin by jumping over it. The captured coin will be collected in the coin back present at the right-side of the board. The movement of the coin is limited by the diagonal lines that are appearing on the board. The game will show you the moves that are valid. There is a five minutes timer that runs along the game. The timer starts a countdown once the game begins. The time is paused as soon as the player has played his move, until the opponent makes his move.
