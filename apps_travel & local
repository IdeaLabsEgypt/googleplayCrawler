You need to disable the notification feature in Settings if this annoys you.- Droid 3: The initial Droid 3 firmware does not implement the satellite status API so you will not see the satellites and the signal strength bars. The rest of the features should work properly.- Motorola phones: On some phones, turning your phone to airplane mode will turn off the GPS receiver, too. This is a hardware limitation.- Droid Charge: Reports 0 altitude.- LG Optimus: The phone cannot report the satellite SNR values correctly (all signal bars will be maxed out).- Samsung phones: Because of a firmware bug, they may report extreme battery consumption for GPS Status even if it is not running at all (other programs using sensors are affected too). This is harmless and no power is consumed! Just ignore it and let's hope that a future firmware upgrade will fix this on your phone.- Nexus One/S: With Andoid 2.3 it cannot report NMEA sentences.

Istanbul's population is estimated to be between 12 and 19 million people, making it also one of the largest in Europe and the world.Istanbul was one of three European Capitals of Culture in 2010With its long history at the center of empires, Istanbul offers a wealth of historic and religious places to take in. The bulk of these ancient monuments, dating back to Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods, including the Hagia Sophia, Topkap\u0131 Palace, Sultanahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque), and Basilica Cistern are located around Sultanahmet Square, while some others are dispersed throughout the peninsula of old city, such as Church of St Savior in Chora (Kariye M\u00fczesi), entire inside of which is covered by mindblowing frescoes and mosaics. An impressive section of mostly intact Theodosian walls, which mark the full length of western boundary of the peninsula, is right next to this particular church.

Sightseeing tours, attractions, excursions, things to do and fun activitiesDubai (\u062f\u0628\u064a Dubayy) is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. It is rather like an independent city-state and is the most modern and progressive emirate in the UAE, developing at an unbelievable pace in the tourist and trade sectors especially. A relatively new tourist destination, Dubai was gaining popularity in recent years until the global economic crash of 2008. Dubai is essentially a desert city with superb infrastructure, liberal policies (by regional standards), that became popular for its excellent tourist amenities. Just 5 h from Europe and 3 h from most parts of the Middle East, the Near East, and the subcontinent of India, Dubai makes a great short break for shopping, partying, sunbathing, fine dining, sporting events, and even a few sinful pleasures. It is a city of superlatives: for the fastest, biggest, tallest, largest and highest, Dubai is the destination. It has the largest immigrant population in the world. The weekly day off is on Friday. Note that, since September 2006, a harmonised weekend of Friday and Saturday has been adopted for the public sector and schools. Government departments, multinational companies, and most schools and universities are now off on Friday and Saturday (after years of a mixed bag of Friday/Saturday and Thursday/Friday weekends). Some local companies still work half a day on Thursday with a full day on Saturday, but larger companies tend to permit relaxation and time off work for their employees on Friday and Saturday.

Unlike standard car navigation systems, Truck GPS Navigation calculates efficient routes based on the vehicle profile information, routing parameters and load type, including hazardous materials.The driver can choose a profile configuration based on length, height, width, weight, max. axle load, and whether he is carrying hazardous goods.The maps are on-board, which means they are stored directly on the device for offline use. At the same time both the maps and the application can be easily updated free of charge.TRY OUT THE APP FOR FREE!Company Aponia Software Ltd. released a new version of the Truck GPS Navigation application designed especially for truck drivers. Together with the update of the application the company launched also the update of CEDA maps for Truck GPS Navigation.The new version of the Truck GPS Navigation application brings several new functions:\u25aa Modernized design of the user interface.\u25aa Extension of the app\u2019s resolution for use on other devices.\u25aa Possibility of customizing the item and font sizes in the menu.\u25aa Possibility of saving the app on a memory stick, once it is used with the Android 4.4 KitKat operating system.\u25aa Possibility of rating the application and thus supporting the development of new versions.At the same time bugs, which might have caused problems in the previous version of the application, were fixed:\u25aa It is possible to enter items from the Favorites list directly into the route via the Route Planner.\u25aa If the navigation is missing necessary coordinates while launched via Intent (Android only), it automatically opens online search.\u25aa Elimination of automatic and incorrect changes of signs in coordinates, once the app is launched via Intent (Android only).\u25aa The application now chooses a skin according to the physical resolution of the display, which does not change. Beforehand the application used to be based on the resolution, in which it can render \u2013 in this case some users coped with problems while rotating the device, as the resolution was different, when the application was set for portrait, and when it was set for landscape.\u25aa If the app doesn\u2019t find a suitable skin for the resolution of the user\u2019s device, it will try to use a skin, which is closest to this resolution.\u25aa Users struggled with the activation of serial numbers, while having no connection to the internet. Also this bug is removed from the update.

The \"end of the world\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts.A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. They are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, with up to seven regions commonly regarded as continents. These are\u2014from largest in size to smallest: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and AustraliaWorld history is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the first civilizations to the present.World population is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, world economy is the sum of the economies of all societies (all countries), especially in the context of globalization. Terms like world championship, gross world product, world flags etc. also imply the sum or combination of all current-day sovereign states.In terms such as world religion, world language, and world war, world suggests international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of the entire world.

If you are unable to view a KML or KMZ file or attachment in Google Earth, then this is the app that you need!KMLZ to Earth allows you to browse through your local files to select a KML or KMZ file to display in Google Earth. It also allows you to view your saved email attachments in Google Earth.In the Explorer activity, if you browse to a directory containing images with location information,* Tap the file icon to view the photo closely* Tap the file name to create a KMZ file * Tap \"View images to create KMZ\" to create a KMZ file with the locations and images from multiple photosIn your email application, save the KML or KMZ file, and then tap it again to choose to view it with KMLZ to Earth.Since Google Earth for Android doesn't seem to have published limits on file sizes, your success with files larger than 4MB may vary. Large files cause Google Earth to to load slowly, or if they are too large, not display them entirely. If this occurs, try to reduce the size of the images used or the number of images selected to create smaller KMZ files.\u00a0The size of the images shown in Google Earth decreases progressively as the total size of images are selected, in order to keep the total file size small enough to view on Google Earth for Android.When creating a KMZ file, each image containing location information is shown as a thumbnail, along with the image name, time taken, resolution and size. Thumbnails can be tapped for a larger preview of the image. All, none, or individual files can be selected to create a KMZ file from images in one directory. DO NOT PUT SPACES OR OTHER STRANGE CHARACTERS IN FILE NAMES! LETTER, NUMBER, UNDERSCORE, PERIOD, AND HYPHEN CHARACTERS ALLOWED. ANY ILLEGAL CHARACTERS WILL BE REPLACED WITH UNDERSCORES.File names must end in \".jpg\", \".kml\", \".kmz\" to be visible to view in KMLZ to Earth, and capitalization does not matter. Files that you select to view are copied to the \"Home\" directory, typically /mnt/sdcard/kmlz. WARNING! Any file that does not end in \".kml\" or \".kmz\" will be deleted automatically from this directory, or when you choose to use Menu, Clear Home, and confirm.The Home button will take you quickly to the /mnt/sdcard/kmlz directory (or a similar path) to see which files you have previously viewed, and view them again.This app can't be set as default for any action, if you try, then it will reset itself. This ensures you the choice of action always and prevents a possible undesirable loop.If experiencing problems with Google Earth, use the Menu, Manage Earth, and either Force Stop, Clear Data, or Clear Cache. Clear Cache is very helpful to get accurate results if you are testing the same file name multiple times.Likewise, if experiencing problems with KMLZ to Earth, use the Menu, Manage KMZL, and either Force Stop, Clear Data, or Clear Cache.This application runs a web server on your device at http://localhost:8001/ to serve pages from it's \"Home\" directory to Google Earth. In order to do this, it will have a running process in the background. A notification will be issued to remind you that this process is running. If you view the notification, then you return to the application, where pressing back will allow you to terminate the application and the background web server process.

The Mediterranean Sea is to the south; the Aegean Sea is to the west; and the Black Sea is to the north. The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia.

It is a main tourist center and second largest city (after Suez) in Egypt located on the Red Sea coast.The city was founded in the early 20th century, and since the 1980s has been continually enlarged by Egyptian and foreign investors to become the leading seashore resort on the Red Sea. Holiday villages and hotels provide aquatic sport facilities for sailboarders, yachtsmen, scuba divers and snorkelers.Hurghada stretches for about 36 kilometres (22 mi) along the seashore, and it does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from Cairo, the Delta and Upper Egypt, as well as package holiday tourists from Europe, notably Italians and Germans. Until a few years ago it was a small fishing village. Today Hurghada counts 248,000 inhabitants and is divided into three parts: Downtown (El Dahar) is the old part; Sekalla is the city center, and El Memsha (Village road) is the modern part. Sakalla is the relatively modest hotel quarter. Dahar is where the town's largest bazaar, the post office and the long-distance bus station are situated.The city is served by the Hurghada International Airport with scheduled passenger traffic to and from Cairo and direct connections with several cities in Europe. The airport has undergone massive renovations to accommodate rising traffic. Hurghada is known for its watersports activities, nightlife and warm weather. Daily temperature hovers round 30 degrees celsius most of the year. Numerous Europeans spend their Christmas and New Year holidays in the city, primarily Germans, Russians and Italians.

The Passbook pass is then stored in PassWallet.Note, this application manages .pkpass files, and will not create passes from other links / webpages / document formats.Backup of Passbook passes (and syncing between devices) possible via Dropbox or Google Drive.Passbook passes can be redeemed via NFC using codeREADr (https://www.codereadr.com), Tap-Thru (http://spirals.co.jp) or other compatible readers.PassWallet is now fully integrated with Renfe (http://www.renfe.com/) in Spain.PassWallet works with Lufthansa (see http://atti.do/pw-lufthansa for details) and other airlines that offer .pkpass files as downloads / email attachments.

These are currently not widely available.Q) A pkpass isn't offered on a website / confirmation email when using an Android device, but is when using iOS. Why?A) Some companies currently block access to pkpass files for non-iOS users. If you could email the company in question (we think it'll hold more weight coming from their customers) and CC passwallet@attidomobile.com we'll do our best to follow it up.Q) Will you be supporting Samsung Wallet?A) We will look into Samsung Wallet should it start being offered to consumers via websites, emails, etc.Q) I click on a link to my ticket and PassWallet isn't on the list of apps. Why?A) Is the link referring to a .pkpass file? If the list of apps are all web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) or PDF viewers (Adobe Reader, Amazon Kindle, etc.) you've probably got a ticket in the form of a web page or PDF.Q) I'm seeing problems with PassWallet. What do I do?A) While we strive to test PassWallet on a good cross section of devices, we are currently compatible with 3,469 different Android devices, each running multiple versions of Android OS, with different network operator customisations. If every app developer tested on ALL of these, there'd be less than a hundred apps in Google Play!

The app contains a locally stored database with over 1300 different APN codes for carriers all over the globe. The app will be updated whenever the list is modified.THIS APP DOES NOT UNLOCK YOUR PHONE.However, if you would like an unlock code you can acquire one here:http://unlockscodes.com/cart.php?group=0&service=imei&aid=f0dd4a99fba6075a9494772b58f95280IMPORTANT NOTE:If you find a SIM that does not have a valid APN in the database please email me so we can find the correct settings together. I would like the APN list to be as complete as possible, but I will need help from everyone. Please check against the database using this free version first. If you happen to know the country you are visiting we can try to improve that countries list before you leave. This helps everyone.How does this app save money?Most cell providers charge outrageous fees for international roaming. You can avoid international roaming fees by purchasing a local SIM. In many countries you can get one for less than $10.In order to do this you need a phone that is not carrier locked (this is not the same as rooting). You can get your phone's unlock code and instructions on how to use it from your carrier. Most of the time you can get this over the phone from your service provider.Using a local SIM will give you a local phone number. However, If the purchased SIM card includes data getting an internet connection requires the service providers APN settings. This can be difficult to get if you do not speak the local language.You can learn more about APN settings and how they work here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Point_NameThis app contains a huge database of known APN settings for SIM cards. Run the app and search for your SIM's APN settings. Then you can add these settings automatically, or in the case of Ice Cream Sandwich users copy and paste the individual settings into a new APN entry.NOTE FOR ICE CREAM SANDWICH AND JELLY BEAN USERS:The current release of Android has disabled the ability to add APN settings with 3rd party software. You will need to use the copy buttons (see the screen shot) and paste the settings into a new APN entry manually. As of now the only way around this limitation requires root access (do this at your own risk) and placing the app in the /system directory.APPLICATION LIMITATIONS:This application will not give your phone signal where it normally will not get it.This application it meant for phones with a GSM antenna. If your phone does not have a SIM slot this application will do nothing for you.My email is provided for support with the application. If you have a GSM phone and have entered a SIM card that was not provided with the phone and the application does not have your APN setting please email me.

Once the app and maps are loaded to the phone or tablet, cellular network coverage or internet connection is not required for real time GPS navigation.Although the Memory-Map app is designed to be used as a standalone GPS navigator, best results are achieved when used in conjunction with Memory-Map on your PC (free download) for planning, printing and loading up maps, waypoints and routes to the phone/tabletMemory-Map includes free access to 1:250,000 scale topographic maps and many other free maps around the world. More detailed maps are available for download and purchase with a free try before you buy, time limited demo option. Available maps include Ordnace Survey, Hema, USGS quads, NOAA, and DeLorme. All maps, including the ones supplied on DVD can be used on your PC and phone. See the help page for details on loading maps to the device from the PC.Features include:Intuitive designFast scrolling and zoomingAccess a vast range of Worldwide maps and charts.Automatically downloads a free map of your current locationCreate and edit marks and routes.Import and export marks, routes and tracks in the open GPX formatDisplay; Position, Course, Speed, Heading, Altitude and averagesPosition coordinates include Lat/Long, UTM and GB GridUnits displayed in Statute, Nautical or MetricAuto-rotate screen (can be locked in preferred orientation)Shows speed and direction of travel, even while walking slowlySupport for GPS and Compass sensors, where available.Placename index,Moving map, lock GPS position and automatically scroll the mapRecords breadcrumb trail / tracklogs.Email position marks or tracklogs as GPX filesSome choice users comments...\"Verdict: The Memory-Map App is a truly excellent, competent product, representing real value for money. It's straightforward to use, with just enough preference settings and options to describe it as customizable. Route-creation and route-following are ridiculously easy to set up, yet provide a tremendous range of route data. You can also import and export GPX files (via email). A really strong product at this price point.\" Andrew Knight, Yacht Arabella blog\"After buying about 6 navigational applications for my tablet I finally got one that really works the way it should. I now have a handheld version of my sailboat's navigation system. I am very happy with this app and would recommend it to any avid sailor\"\"I've tried all the mapping/tracking applications I can find and I rate this best. The 1:25k scale is essential for walkers and the ability to create a route at home or to log it (recording your time & distance etc) as you go along is superb. I like the direction indicator to show where you are heading on the map, the ability to save, describe and name tracks is neat. It's easy to slide the map about from your current position to see where you are heading next, the zooming in and out facility is good. I found it reasonably easy to learn how to use it and reliable.\"\"This is not a cheap navigation program, it is a professional tool for viewing raster maps. And for this purpose, it is excellent. For viewing topo maps, this is the best software and hardware combination for the job, this alone was my reason to get an Android tablet, and it was the right decision.\"\"This is by far the best mapping/GPS app and I've got them all. It's simple to use but has many more user options for points of interest, tracking, routes and maps.\"Love this app. Have wanted a chance to use my Memory-Map maps on my Android phone for ages - less devices to carry, better maps than on my handheld GPS, and a great conversation piece!

Located on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its square-mile mediaeval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, the name London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms the London region and the Greater London administrative area, governed by the elected Mayor of London and the London Assembly.London is the leading global city,  with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transport all contributing to its prominence. It is one of the world's leading financial centres  and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on measurement. London has been described as a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London's 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to host the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don\u2019t have ADS-B transponders.Traditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This data provides near real-time coverage of all US and Canadian airspace.http://www.flightradar24.com/how-it-works***IMPORTANT NOTICES***Minimum required screen resolution is 320x480px.If you are only interested in tracking air traffic in a specific region, we suggest that you check Flightradar24.com BEFORE purchasing the app. Flightradar24 provides unrivaled positional aircraft data coverage around the world but there are areas where we don\u2019t have coverage.

{"app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.OfflineSIMAPNDatabasePro", "price": "EGP13.85", "Description": " Offline APN Database is for international travelers who like saving money on cell voice and data service by using a local SIM card purchased at their destination. The app contains a locally stored database with over 1300 different APN codes for carriers all over the globe. The app will be updated whenever the list is modified.IMPORTANT NOTE:If you find a SIM that does not have a valid APN in the database please email me the settings displayed on the first screen so we can find the correct settings together. I would like the APN list to be as complete as possible, but I will need help from everyone. Please check against the database using the free version first.I wrote this app for my own travels, so I have a personal desire for it to work whenever I happen to be. I don't want to buy a SIM I can't get the settings for either.How does this app save money?Most cell providers charge outrageous fees for international roaming. You can avoid international roaming fees by purchasing a local SIM. In many countries you can get one for less than $10.In order to do this you need a phone that is not carrier locked (this is not the same as rooting). You can get your phone's unlock code and instructions on how to use it from your carrier. Most of the time you can get this over the phone from your service provider.Using a local SIM will give you a local phone number. However, If the purchased SIM card includes data getting an internet connection requires the service providers APN settings. This can be difficult to get if you do not speak the local language.You can learn more about APN settings and how they work here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Point_NameThis app contains a huge database of known APN settings for SIM cards. Run the app and search for your SIM's APN settings. Then you can add these settings automatically, or in the case of Ice Cream Sandwich users copy and paste the individual settings into a new APN entry.PROFESSIONAL VERSION:The professional version displays the SIM phone number if available, and adds the ability to browse the included APN database by country. This will allow people to check on what APN strings are in the system before traveling to a new destination.NOTE FOR ICE CREAM SANDWICH AND JELLY BEAN USERS:The current release of Android has disabled the ability to add APN settings with 3rd party software. You will need to use the copy buttons (see the screen shot) and paste the settings into a new APN entry manually. As of now the only way around this limitation requires root access (do this at your own risk) and placing the app in the /system directory.APPLICATION LIMITATIONS:This application will not give your phone signal where it normally will not get it.This application it meant for phones with a GSM antenna. If your phone does not have a SIM slot this application will do nothing for you.My email is provided for support with the application. If you have a GSM phone and have entered a SIM card that was not provided with the phone and the application does not have your APN setting please email me. If you have any other issue please contact your service provider.

From Hiddencoft Vineyards at the northern tip of the state, to Rosemont Winery at the North Carolina border, and over to MountainRose Vineyard in coal country, just a few miles from Kentucky, Rick took more than 10,000 photos, Nancy interviewed hundreds of owners, winemakers, and tasting room staff, and together they sampled more than 2,000 Virginia wines. Since the \"150 Wineries\" tour, the authors have continued to visit new wineries, and revisit old friends. They expect to hit the magical \"200\" number in 2013! They live in Northern Virginia, and they can\u2019t wait to get on the road again.\u2605 About Sutro Media \u2605This guide is published in partnership with Sutro Media.

Detailed maps are not available for all airports, but we are continuously adding new ones. Airport information, particularly concerning amenities and parking fees, change rapidly. We are dedicated to making iFly the best resource available for airport information, but sometimes there might be a delay in updating our data. Additionally, many airports simply don't provide detailed information in a timely manner after they make a change. We are constantly updating our data to reflect the most relevant information possible. Flight tracking is subject to the timely delivery of data to iFly from the FAA, the airports, and the airlines. At rare times these data sources are not all in sync with each other, causing a conflict in the flight status of a particular flight.Additionally, GPS or cellular coverage may not provide sufficient In-Terminal navigation capabilities in all terminals.Thanks for your understanding!-The iFly Team----------------------------------Feedback and SupportWe encourage feedback on any aspect of iFly. Please also report any data anomalies so we can quickly fix or update them. Thanks!

Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey. After Sicily and Sardinia, Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. Although the island is geographically in Asia it is politically a European country and is a member of the European Union. Cyprus is divided into 6 administrative regions, each named for its administrative capital. Since 1974, the whole of Kyrenia district, most of Famagusta district, and the northern portion of Nicosia district are occupied by Turkish forces. The Turkish Cypriot community administers those areas. The Republic of Cyprus administers the following districts: Famagusta, Larnaca (Larnaka), Limassol, Nicosia and Paphos.The mappa map covers Larnaca International Airport (LCA) and is on the outskirts of Larnaka. Travel around and see many archaeological sites scattered around the island, dating from the New Stone Age through to the Roman Empire, beautiful coastline, Nicosia the capital, the Troodos mountains, rising as high as 1952 metres, quaint little villages such as Kakopetria, Platres and Phini and the 14th century building Hamam Omerye in Nicosia a restored hammam.Top 5 reasons to get your offline mappa map for Cyprus:1.

Not that we had the chance to notice, sucked immediately as we were into the ferny lush of the local forest, onto trails built by mountain bikers with mountain bikers in mind. Trails in verdant shade that dip weave and roll. Trails that snake through the trees in a way that makes hard riders hoot with joy yet at the same time could coax a huge grin to the face of a 70-year-old granma on her first bike ride ever. Candy Land. A lucky utopia. Sure gawk at the geysers, wrinkle your nose at the sulphury mud holes, soak in the hot springs, buy greenstone trinkets, but get down on your knees and kiss the mulchy earth of these trails because they are the true hidden treasure here\u201d.

It will show you name and distance (and sometimes altitude) for the most important hill- and mountain tops in the terrain around you. When your device is flat you see a compass with arrows pointing towards the tops, and when it's held upright you see an augmented reality camera view. In camera view you can take photos, and the name of the tops and other places will be printed on the picture.The app can also display a map, where tops whitin a radius of aproximately 100 km are marked. A blue marker means that there are related hiking blogs at Norsk fjellforum, and you can open these blogs directly from the app (though most of them will be in Norwegian). The app is available in English and in Norwegian.(Do you also have a hiking blog? You can add it to the list by registering it at http://www.fjellforum.no).The app uses offline data from several different sources, in total more than 10 000 Norwegian hills and mountains. You can choose to see markers for all tops, only above 1000 meters, or only above 2000 meters.Offline data menas that the app will also work whithout an Internet connections, but with a few exception: You need Internet connection if you want to download new maps and lists of blogs. These will be temporary stored on your device, and consequently work partly offline later. You also need Internet connection the first time you are starting the app, so it can do a piracy check. A new check of this will be done at least every third month.Want to test before your buy? Check out the free apps \"7-fjellskompasset\" and \"Norwegian Towns and Villages\".

In Google Play will also be a free version of this application, but it is necessary to route each additional load for 1-2 dollars. Here, all the excursions downloading time, one of them you get a gift! In addition, each route, which we later will add to the application, you get a FREE! Save time and money - download version of \"PRO\"!5 REASONS TO DOWNLOAD:- It really is a quality product all excursions prepared tours of Rome and voiced by a professional announcer.- All at once you download the audio guide is not just, and full multimedia application, within which there audiorasskazy, descriptions of attractions, photos and a map of the city.- Offline-card: after downloading, open and examine it a little map of the city. So it will remain in the phone memory and on arrival in Rome will work without a network connection, which is important in terms of roaming.- Cheaper than you can imagine: download the app for $ 4 and save time and money, instead of having to download 4 trips cost $ 1-2 individually.- Ideal travel: you yourself will decide what, where and when you are seeing. You can walk at any time of the day, slowly for a tour group staying at the snacks, photosets and shopping and carrying around heavy paper guides. Convenient, is not it?IMPORTANT!- Recommended to download the application by connecting to wi-fi: audio files and photos \"weigh\" a lot, and we do not want to \"eat\" all your mobile traffic ;)- Once the application is installed, be sure to open it and \"walk around\" in different sections: see routes, study the map, read the descriptions of attractions. So our content is fully loaded and will be available even in offline-mode.- Prolonged use of an audio guide with GPS drains the battery much faster than your phone.

A Hidden Mickey is an image of Mickey Mouse concealed in the design of a Disney attraction or resort. Traditionally, it takes the shape of Mickey\u2019s head and ears in silhouette (one large circle with two smaller circles on top), but Hidden Mickeys can also take on many forms. The most common Hidden Mickey is three circles that form Mickey\u2019s head and ears. Other images include a side profile of Mickey\u2019s face and head as found on Peter Pan as you fly over the city, a full picture of Mickey Mouse found on Splash Mountain, or even a Mickey stuffed animal hidden on Star Tours. Sometimes, just Mickey\u2019s gloves, handprints, shoes or ears appear. Even his name or initials in unusual places are discovered as Hidden Mickeys. Disney Imagineers have been cleverly concealing Hidden Mickeys throughout Walt Disney attractions for decades. Can you find them all? Or maybe be the first to discover a new Hidden Mickey! Guide your way through Disneyland using our Hidden Mickey finder. Carefully detailed descriptions will help you discover each location where Disney cast members have placed Hidden Mickeys. Enhance your vacation experience by finding some of the hidden Magic at Disneyland!

We have created this app with the aim of helping you make the most of your visit to this iconic part of the National Park and also to raise vital funds for the Three Peaks Project which maintains the footpaths and bridleways in the area. On the app you will find descriptions and OS 1:50,000 maps for the famous Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge route, plus alternative routes up each of the Three Peaks. There are route descriptions and OS maps showing suggested mountain bike routes around each of the peaks too. In addition we have packed the app with geolocated places of interest (POIs) which range from archaeological sites through to nature reserves so you can discover even more about the area when you visit. There are also stunning 360\u00b0 panoramas from the summits; an augmented reality \u2018toposcope\u2019 for each of the three peaks (requires free Layar app); advice on what to wear and what equipment to bring; information on travel, accommodation and places to eat plus lots of ways of sharing your experiences online and for challenging yourself and your mates. Because the 3G signal in the Three Peaks area can be a bit iffy we have frontloaded the app with all the maps and most of the other information, so you will be able to use it wherever you are. We\u2019ve also listed all the places we know of in the area where you can get free wifi for the cost of a cup of tea or pint of beer, so you can explore some of the external links within the app too.Please remember that this app is designed to help you plan your trip and be a companion when you arrive. It should NEVER be used as a substitute for a map and compass when you are out in the mountains. Please don\u2019t embarrass yourself (or us) by having to call out the Fell Rescue just because your phone battery died!The development of this app was made possible through the generous funding of the European Outdoor Conservation Association \u2013 a group of businesses in the European outdoor industry that grant-aids conservation projects worldwide. The grant was secured by the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust on our behalf. Every penny we make from sales of this app goes towards our work in the Three Peaks area, repairing the heavily-used paths and helping visitors get the most from their visit.

But, since many of the interesting sites on the Hana Highway have no signs, these books use \u201cmile markers\u201d. This means that you have to look at the side of the road for these signs, while driving on a slow, winding, and unfamiliar highway. How fun is that?With Maui Road to Hana, you receive audio notifications before you come to a site. Then when you arrive, a display pops up with a picture of the place. You get to enjoy the sights and sounds of the Hana Highway, and Maui Road to Hana does the rest.Maui Road to Hana does not require a cell phone connection for our notifications to alert you.

The entire State Lines database is integrated into the application, so State Lines works when you are out of cellular or WiFi coverage.When you visit a new state, have you ever wondered:\u2023 What restraints for my kids are required in this state?\u2023 Is the sales tax lower over the next state line?\u2023 Is the fuel tax cheaper here?\u2023 Can I buy beer in the grocery stores?\u2023 Can I overnight in rest areas?\u2023 Is smoking allowed in restaurants?\u2023 Are radar detectors legal?\u2023 Can I make a left turn on red?\u2023 Are helmets & eye protection required?State Lines is an essential application for anyone traveling around the United States - whether by RV, car, train, bike, plane, or boat. No matter how you travel, if you\u2019re frequently crossing state lines, you need State Lines.State Lines is a growing project, and we welcome feedback on ideas for other useful state specific information to include in future versions. Please let us know what else you would like us to track!******NOTE; State Lines is intended to provide an at-a-glance summarized guide to rules and regulations, and it is not an exhaustive legal reference. While every effort has been made to provide quality up to date data, no warranty for accuracy of data is expressed or implied. State Lines assumes no responsibility for how you utilize the data. Keep in mind, local regulations can often override state level rules (so while a state may not have a cell phone ban, a city may - which will not be reflected in State Lines), and laws frequently change. Always verify with the proper authorities before assuming anything.Gun Laws: Please note, State Lines has not included this feature in a long time. We originally launched with it, but it's a highly complex subject matter and very critical. Since our launch, the app 'Legal Heat' came out which focuses on this one subject, and is regularly updated by gun enthusiast attorneys - the exact people you want tracking these laws. So, we dropped our short summaries of gun laws - we'll leave that to the experts. We will be keeping State Lines up to date by doing periodic updates to our research - usually twice a year. This is a time consuming manual research process, and we appreciate your patience and understanding that State Lines may be a few months behind new law changes. You can help tho - if you do discover any out-of-date information in State Lines, please contact us at statelines@technomadia.com. Thanks!

Indeed, the Smokies is the most visited national park in the country--and this guide will show you why. It covers the best things to do in the national park as well as attractions, restaurants, accommodations, and shopping opportunities in the surrounding gateway communities of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, Townsend, and Cherokee. (The most popular locations are covered in the greatest depth.)Whatever your bliss--going miniature golfing amidst dinosaurs, hiking to waterfalls you can walk behind, floating in mid-air at a skydiving simulator, discovering chic sandwich shops and gourmet hotspots, soaking in a private hot tub with amazing mountain views, or shopping for outlet bargains and local crafts--this essential guide's got you covered.With this app you can: * get the real insider's scoop on what to see and do in the Smokies* sort entries you want to read by geographic area, by price, or by category * view more than 2,400 gorgeous images* get prices, rates, and hours* link directly to an entry's webpage and/or call its phone number* get turn-by-turn directions and see it on a map\u2605 About the Author \u2605Travel writer and Knoxville resident Katy Koontz has been hooked on the Smokies for more than two decades. She's shrieked in their haunted houses, snapped up their Appalachian crafts, hit holes-in-one on their miniature golf courses (that's putt putt to you fellow locals), hiked their peaks, biked their valleys, gone tubing down their cold mountain rivers, whizzed through their treetops on ziplines, rode horseback through their woods, and rolled down their slopes inside a giant Zorb sphere. (She's even snorkeled the Smokies!) Her research has taken her to every corner of the gateway towns of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, Townsend, and Cherokee to regularly report on the newest and craziest attractions, the best places to stay (for romantic getaways as well as family vacations), and the greatest grub the region has to dish out.

In addition, each route, which we later will add to the application, you get a FREE!

So it will remain in the phone memory and on arrival in Paris will work without a network connection, which is important in terms of roaming.- Cheaper than you can imagine: download the app for $ 3 and save time and money, instead of downloaded individually 4 trips to the dollar.- Ideal travel: you yourself will decide what, where and when you are seeing. You can walk at any time of the day, slowly for a tour group staying at the snacks, photosets and shopping and carrying around heavy paper guides. Convenient, is not it?IMPORTANT!- Recommended to download the application by connecting to wi-fi: audio files and photos \"weigh\" a lot, and we do not want to \"eat\" all your mobile traffic ;)- Once the application is installed, be sure to open it and \"walk around\" in different sections: see routes, study the map, read the descriptions of attractions.

{"Description": " Now in their third year the wisepilgrim guides are the definitive app to help you to Santiago de Compostela. Built off the hand written notes of a veteran pilgrim, the app is updated monthly with new content and new features.This guide covers the Camino Franc\u00e9s, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned for Android and now works almost exclusively offline. To use the map features, or to share your comments with other guide owners, will require a data connection. As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.FEATURES:Albergue Directory. A full directory of Albergues, and notes on which towns have alternative accommodation like camping, hotels, pensions, and casas rurales.Stage Guide. Full directory of villages along the way, in the order in which you pass them, with accurate listings of what services are available.Location Aware. Every location is geo-coded. Photos. Photos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way. Maps. If you have a data connection, or are connected to wifi, you can view the locations of every point on a map. Unfortunately, this feature is unavailable without a connection.Scrollable Elevation Map. This one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls South to North. One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.Comments. Albergue closed early for the season? Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about? Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others.

But not to worry because the Mt. Whitney Guide app uses a combination of your phone's GPS, downloaded topo maps, and the Google Maps interface to accurately locate your position on the trail.  The Mt. Whitney Guide takes the guess work out of wondering how much farther you have to go, and more importantly, whether you are still on the trail.  A bright red line indicates the location of the main trail on the map.  Side trails are indicated in blue. Waypoints of interest to the hiker are plotted on the map. There are also markers on the map every mile or kilometer of the trail track.The elevation profile shows trail distance vs elevation and plots your current location on the trail. Each waypoint is plotted on the profile. Each waypoints is clickable, opening to the waypoint's detail page.The guidebook lists every waypoint in order by distance along the trail. Each waypoint includes a detail page, providing further details about that particular waypoint. Details include the waypoint's mileage point and elevation, photographs of the waypoint, distance northbound and southbound to the next water source, a Trail Register where you may post comments and read other users' comments, and other details that will help you during your hike, and help you plan your hike.
