Updating the game- Your cars and money are saved on your device. DO NOT EVER uninstall the game before updating, or you will lose ALL of your stuff.1. Racing- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green - If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard - Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy - Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!2. Cars and upgrades- Test drive before you buy a car!- The more your car costs, the tougher opposition you'll face both offline and online- Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesn't- Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage- Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -> Upgrade -> Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings3. Game modes and winnings- Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car- Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP- Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP- If your car isn't ready for online races, earn some cash in \"Drivers Battle\"- For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League4. Misc- Like http://facebook.com/DragRacingGame for news and strategy- Visit the official forums: http://www.dragracingforum.net- Try playing with vibration on (enable it in the \"Settings\" menu)!- If the game runs slow on your phone, use the task manager to kill unnecessary background tasks- XPERIA PLAY Optimized  ", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "reviewers": "1676341", "operating_system": "Varies with device", "developer": "Creative Mobile", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dragracing.creative-mobile.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFAgv-yBNiMZ3WtaHAICVgwyUW91w", "title": "Drag Racing", "email": "support@creative-mobile.com", "rating": "4.443017959594727", "date_published": "August 21, 2014", "category": "Racing", "downloads": "100,000,000 - 500,000,000", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Creative+Mobile"}

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.Proximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.If you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.WHAT DOES IT MEANS \"DRIFTING\"?Drifting is a racing technique where the driver make the car oversteer, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels or all tires, while maintaining control from entry to exit of a corner. A car is drifting when the rear wheels are slipping more than the front wheels, to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or viceversa). Drifting involves hi speed cars, skilled drivers and hardcore fans.We will update and improve Real Drift constantly.
