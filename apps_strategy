How will you command them? \u2714 Different maps with different play styles.\u2714 Your tactics depend on the set of units you chose for battle.This game provides a fresh approach to tower defense/RTS genres. The main goal is to hold a city while an army of zombies tries to overpower and capture your base.

Alternatively you can try to hold limited territory, but you will be facing a resource shortage in a week or so. All maps have numerous strategic possibilities so you can tailor your tactics. Your play style will be highly dependant on the units you'll have selected. Choose wisely. Will you use artillery to kill enemies at distance? Or, will you stick to close combat using infantry and barricading buildings to win?The year is 2053.

Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!

If you lose your capital for 3 turns, your civilization will no longer exist. If you capture another civilization\u2019s capital, you obtain all of its provinces. Capitals have a defensive bonus: +15% and an offensive bonus: +15%. Capitals have all buildings already constructed.- Transparent provinces are neutral.

You can move between provinces you control or attack another civilization\u2019s province.- Recruit: recruit units from the selected province.

The battle for the Russian Front was a pivotal moment in World War 2, and this game gives it the scale it deserves.Experience grand strategy across the entire theatre of the Eastern Front; the military conflict that many consider to be the iconic attacker/defender scenario. Command massive armies at your fingertips, in this fully 3D turn-based simulation of one of the largest military campaigns in history, playable as both Germans and Russians.Start in the early days of Operation Barbarossa and follow the German invasion of Russia through to its ultimate failure.  Or start later in the war and jump straight into the Russian counter push to Berlin. A massive 108 turn campaign will take you from the opening stages to a final, overwhelming Russian offensive. Four shorter Operations, spanning 16 turns each, take place from June to December of each year and offer a more condensed experience.The bitter weather on the Eastern Front was as much a danger as the opposing forces, and the game reflects this with a seasonal cycle that has a profound effect on your tactics as you struggle to hold out through the vicious Winter until reinforcements arrive in Summer. Players must also deal with fog of war effects, and will be able to cut off their opponent's supply lines, while making sure their own stay secure.Key Features- Play the colossal 108 turn campaign, or pick from 4 other points in history to start from.- Large 3D map representing the entire Eastern Front; stretching from Berlin to Stalingrad.- Play as both the Soviet and German army, each with unique tanks, vehicles and uniforms.- 4 Historical Operations: Barbarossa, Case Blue, Citadel and Bagration.- Real historical Corps and Armies from several countries.- Strategically reinforce units in vital locations.- Selectable difficulty to tailor your experience to your play style.- Hours of GameplayFind us on Facebook - facebook.com/huntedcow\u2028 Follow us on Twitter - @HuntedCow \u2028 Game Forum - forums.huntedcow.com/hexwar \u2028\u2028 Thank you for supporting our games! \u00a9 2014 Hunted Cow Studios Ltd. \u00a9 2014 HexWar Ltd. \u00a9 2014 Electric Rune, LLC.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Joni+Nuutinen", "Description": " This is a 10 turn demo of Conflicts: Demyansk Pocket 1942, a turn based strategy game which takes place on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. Historical background: During the attacks of the winter of 1941-1942 the Soviet Red Army managed to encircle 100,000 German soldiers holding the front line in Demyansk, located roughly half-way between Moscow and Leningrad. After receiving reinforcements, Wehrmacht unleashed an offensive from Staraya Russa. The purpose of this was not to evacuate the encircled units, but to re-open a dubious land connection to the out-of-supply forces in a hope to continue controlling the area in a preparation for the future campaigns. Meanwhile, the encircled units, inadequacy supplied by Luftwaffe, engaged in a cutthroat battle for the life or death. One of the encircled German units was the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf, which earned its elite formation status in the fierce battles leading the defence of the pocket - a process in which the unit - also known as Death's Head - suffered 80% casualties. However, the German victory in Demyansk in 1942 paved way for a horrible German miscalculation a year later, when 300,000 German soldiers were encircled in Stalingrad in 1943, and applying experiences from the Demyansk operation the commanders were ordered to wait for the help instead of immediately breaking out.Game: You take the command of both the encircled units and the fresh divisions attempting to re-establish a land route from Staraya Russa to Demyansk as quickly as possible. To have a chance to seize the top spot in the Hall of Fame you need to skillfully lead units through the Red Army rifle divisions as quickly as possible - and maintain the newly opened route for 7 consecutive turns. All this while fiercely defending the cut-off Demyansk area with poorly supplied Wehrmacht and auxiliary units.Objective: The game is over after you re-establish a connection between the cities of Staraya Russa and Demyansk - and maintain that connection for seven consecutive turns.The full version of Demyansk Pocket 1942 is available at http://bit.ly/H4HonVSettings: Various options are available to alter the look of the gaming experience: Switch between terrain color themes, change difficulty level, choose icon set for units (NATO or REAL), decide what is drawn on the map, change font and hexagon sizes.In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely a good idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.Answer the call of duty and join Conflict series on Facebook or Google Plus!+ http://on.fb.me/wsC2QV (FB)+ http://bit.ly/GHHGU1 (G+)Tablet friendly: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.Join your fellow strategy gamers in saving the German troops from the encirclement!To see all the campaigns and scenarios in the Conflicts strategy game series visit: http://bit.ly/GRhzqH  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudworth.demyanskpocket_demo", "category": "Strategy", "title": "Demyansk Pocket 1942 (DEMO)", "email": "alephh@gmail.com", "downloads": "500 - 1,000", "developer": "Joni Nuutinen", "price": "0", "rating": "4.1875", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "content_rating": "Medium Maturity", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/GRhzqH&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFZXEU3KQjQE9iiV4J12K7rd4A5Gg", "date_published": "September 14, 2014", "reviewers": "16"}

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=DK+Simulations", "Description": " Operation Husky was the code name for the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. This was the first return, in earnest, of the Western Allied powers to the continent of Europe since the disastrous withdrawal of the BEF from France in 1940.Two armies were involved: The US 7th Army, commanded by Patton, and the British 8th Army, commanded by Montgomery. They faced a variety of Axis formations, from demoralised Italian coastal defences to tougher German mechanised troops, remnants of the Afrika Corps and Italian elites.This game allows you to play either the Allied invasion, or the Axis defenders. The aim of the Allies is to capture the 3 principle cities of Sicily (Catania, Palermo and Messina) as quickly as possible. The Axis must prevent this.You can either play another person hot-seat, or either side against your device.There are 3 options you can set:Allied reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more reinforcements from the historical floating reserves.Axis reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more German and Italian reinforcements could be sent.Landing site: The historical site chosen was not the original one - there was an alternative Western site.In all, there are 147 selectable combinations, plus you can set any of the options to a random choice.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=XTeam+Software+Solution", "Description": " Retaliation is a new and original turn-based strategy wargame.  Do you enjoy the fun of playing Risk but you've often felt limited by its simplicity?  Are you curious about wargames but daunted by complex rules and extreme realism?  Then Retaliation is the game for you: easy to learn, fast to play and yet challenging and never repeating.  Both the casual gamer looking for a quick tank battle and the cunning armchair strategist desiring to find alternative ways to solve war scenarios will greatly enjoy playing Retaliation: simple rules but endless strategy.  The basic premise is similar to other turn-based strategy games: you conquer land to access resources needed to enlarge your army in order to be able to launch assaults and eventually vanquish the enemy. Depending on the terrain and layout of the particular map, different strategies will need to be used. Often the maps are not symmetrical and you'll need to use a very different strategy from the one the computer is using.  There are always many ways to achieve the same goal: different strategies that can be adopted. Do you like hoarding power and launching a single total assault with a huge army? Do you prefer instead a war of attrition, with constant harassment of enemy supply lines? Are your soldiers hiding or advancing? Are you cautiously flanking the enemy or daringly assaulting her frontally? Will you let the enemy hold those rich resources or will you wrestle them to the last man?  But most importantly... are you feeling lucky? Remember: not everything goes as planned...  If you like turn-based strategy games, you will love Retaliation. If you don't like turn-based strategy games, you will probably fall in love with them after playing Retaliation!

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Simsam", "Description": " A Cool Math Game for Children of All Ages We are not all born to like math. In fact, if you probably recall your first encounters with this discipline, you probably remember that you may not have liked it very much. And yet, knowing basic math is such a basic component of our education that simply skipping it is impossible. Children nowadays are luckier than we used to be when we were their age because they have access to fun math games that make them actually like this discipline. Your kid may still be in primary school, but that does not mean that he/she is not forming opinions and preferences. If he/she starts hating math at this age, it is very likely that he/she will hate it later on as well. Now is the time to help him understand not simply the importance of doing math, but also the importance of having fun with it. Your child may become a great mathematician, programmer or physician one day \u2013 don\u2019t limit his/her options from this very young age and teach him that math practice is not a chore, but that it can be a great and fun game as well.  Math Games for Kids: The Best Way to Train Your Kids\u2019 Brain Kids math is not difficult to understand for us as adults, but it is indeed difficult for your little one.
