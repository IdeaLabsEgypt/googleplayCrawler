Tanks with artillery support vs zombies? How will you command them? \u2714 Different maps with different play styles.\u2714 Your tactics depend on the set of units you chose for battle.This game provides a fresh approach to tower defense/RTS genres. The main goal is to hold a city while an army of zombies tries to overpower and capture your base. You can try fast expansion, but it could stretch your forces lotto far so you won't be able to defend properly. Alternatively you can try to hold limited territory, but you will be facing a resource shortage in a week or so. All maps have numerous strategic possibilities so you can tailor your tactics. Your play style will be highly dependant on the units you'll have selected. Choose wisely. Will you use artillery to kill enemies at distance? Or, will you stick to close combat using infantry and barricading buildings to win?The year is 2053. An unknown bio-weapon has been released from top secret laboratories and has now turned 86% of the world\u2019s population into unnatural abominations. Only a secret military group, known as Iron Corps can put an end to this global threat.NOTE ABOUT IN APP PURCHASES:The in app purchases are completely optional.

If you lose your capital for 3 turns, your civilization will no longer exist. If you capture another civilization\u2019s capital, you obtain all of its provinces. Capitals have a defensive bonus: +15% and an offensive bonus: +15%. Capitals have all buildings already constructed.- Transparent provinces are neutral.

If scale is other than standard on minimap you can see '!' in top right.- Use the Economy and Population buttons to view each province\u2019s Economy and Population values. Use the diplomacy button to view each province\u2019s owner and engage in diplomacy (see Orders- Diplomacy View).\u2022 Treasury- Money is added to your treasury through income tax, which is based off your civilization\u2019s total population and economy. Money is subracted from your treasury for military upkeep, which is based off your amount of military units (units at sea have a higher upkeep than units on land).\u2022 Orders - Normal View- Move: move units from one province to another. You can move between provinces you control or attack another civilization\u2019s province.- Recruit: recruit units from the selected province. This costs money and is limited by the population of the province. Recruiting from a province reduces its population.- Build: construct a building in the selected province (see Building Types). This costs money.- Disband: remove units from the selected province. This decreases military upkeep.- Vassal: creates a vassal state with another civilization.- Annex: brings a vassal state back under your full control.\u2022 Orders - Diplomacy View- War: declare war on a civilization.- Peace: submit a peace offer to a civilization. If accepted, your civilizations will no longer be at war.- Pact: submit a pact offer to a civilization. If accepted, the civilizations cannot attack each other for five rounds. This can be canceled through a War order one round in advance.- Alliance: submit an alliance offer to a civilization. If accepted, that civilization will aid you in your military efforts.

The battle for the Russian Front was a pivotal moment in World War 2, and this game gives it the scale it deserves.Experience grand strategy across the entire theatre of the Eastern Front; the military conflict that many consider to be the iconic attacker/defender scenario. Command massive armies at your fingertips, in this fully 3D turn-based simulation of one of the largest military campaigns in history, playable as both Germans and Russians.Start in the early days of Operation Barbarossa and follow the German invasion of Russia through to its ultimate failure.  Or start later in the war and jump straight into the Russian counter push to Berlin. A massive 108 turn campaign will take you from the opening stages to a final, overwhelming Russian offensive. Four shorter Operations, spanning 16 turns each, take place from June to December of each year and offer a more condensed experience.The bitter weather on the Eastern Front was as much a danger as the opposing forces, and the game reflects this with a seasonal cycle that has a profound effect on your tactics as you struggle to hold out through the vicious Winter until reinforcements arrive in Summer. Players must also deal with fog of war effects, and will be able to cut off their opponent's supply lines, while making sure their own stay secure.Key Features- Play the colossal 108 turn campaign, or pick from 4 other points in history to start from.- Large 3D map representing the entire Eastern Front; stretching from Berlin to Stalingrad.- Play as both the Soviet and German army, each with unique tanks, vehicles and uniforms.- 4 Historical Operations: Barbarossa, Case Blue, Citadel and Bagration.- Real historical Corps and Armies from several countries.- Strategically reinforce units in vital locations.- Selectable difficulty to tailor your experience to your play style.- Hours of GameplayFind us on Facebook - facebook.com/huntedcow\u2028 Follow us on Twitter - @HuntedCow \u2028 Game Forum - forums.huntedcow.com/hexwar \u2028\u2028 Thank you for supporting our games! \u00a9 2014 Hunted Cow Studios Ltd. \u00a9 2014 HexWar Ltd. \u00a9 2014 Electric Rune, LLC.
