You will need to select and set Stormfly from your list of live wallpapers before any images will be displayed on your homescreen.Stormfly brings you live weather information in the form of beautifully designed HD wallpaper graphics. Based on your set location, Stormfly will look up your current weather condition, download the matching weather graphic and display the image as your device\u2019s wallpaper. The wallpaper will automatically update and change appropriately at your set interval and at different times of day, such as sunrise/sunset, daytime and night.  Optionally you can turn on the new \"Stalker Mode\" to have the location automatically update in the app as your location changes.  We have also added a new persistent notification that will display the current temperature in the notification bar when collapsed.  When expanded it will display more detailed current weather information.  This new feature replaces the previous double tap option.The images are static, meaning they are not animated. They are also not all stored on your device. Why do we do this? We do this in order to keep both the size of the app and resource usage to a bare minimum. Worried about bandwidth usage? We\u2019ve got you covered! Stormfly will cache the last 10 wallpaper images on your device. When it is set to check for new weather information, it will check the local cache for the correct wallpaper image prior to attempting to download it.Would you like to view the current weather condition? We have provided you with two means of doing just that. The first way is to simply pull down and view the new persistent notification. You can change your temperature readout preferences between fahrenheit and celsius within the settings. The other way requires a specific setup on your device. If you have both Android 4.2+ and the DashClock app installed, you will automatically get a new DashClock extension. What makes the Stormfly extension different from the default one? Honestly, not much. The most noticeable difference will be the icons. The default extension uses only a handful of different icons. Our version includes an icon for each weather condition that will accurately portray it day or night.Features:\u2600 \u2013 Day, night and sunrise/sunset graphics to ensure the wallpaper matches your current weather condition.\u2600 \u2013 Optional setting to display temperature in either Fahrenheit and Celsius.\u2600 \u2013 Optional \"Stalker Mode\" which will allow the app to follow your location as it changes.\u2600 \u2013 Persistent notification option to display current weather conditions.\u2600 \u2013 Comes complete with built in DashClock extension for displaying the current weather info.\u2600 \u2013 Coming soon, celestial events!100% of proceeds will go directly to a cancer patient in need.

These bring pressure, temperature, humidity & UV sensors into a package that attaches to your keyring, never needs charging and sends data via Bluetooth LE.

We are working with numerous meteorological institutions, including the Univ. of Washington, Birmingham Univ. and the UK Met Office. Your readings help us improve weather forecasting for everyone! Featured in the New Scientist and Scientific American! http://bit.ly/1aFY3Ls*Thermometer readings are experimental!**** This app is experimental! Individual TEMPERATURE readings may be incorrect, but when averaged over many users we get reliable information for our community powered maps. ***The app works best on the Galaxy S4 since it has the most sensors. Get a StormTag to add sensors to your phone.The WeatherSignal app can measure:\u2713 Pressure (certain devices only)\u2713 Temperature (see note)\u2713 Light Intensity \u2713 Humidity (Galaxy S4 only) \u2713 Magnetic Flux \u2713 Acceleration (turn on in application settings)This app features Google's Activity Recognition: monitor when you're walking, in vehicle, on a bicycle. Save the results to CSV and perform your own analysis/create maps, for example for quantified self. *** TEMPERATURE ***We\u2019ve come up with an algorithm that translates battery temperature into ambient temperature \u2013 making your phone a thermometer. For each user this is approximate but there is a very strong correlation between battery and ambient temperature when spread over a crowd of users. If you are using a cell phone without an external thermometer then the temperature reading you\u2019ll see is a battery temperature reading converted through our algorithm. Often the algorithm will get it wrong, but we've shown that with appropriate averaging and filtering, these readings correlate extremely well with external ambient air temperature.The Galaxy S4, which has an ambient air temperature thermometer, may produce incorrect readings if the phone is hot due to use.*** PRESSURE ****Devices that contain barometers include:Galaxy NexusGalaxy S3, S4, Note (1,2,3)Nexus 4Nexus 10XoomRAZR MAXX HDXiaomi MI-2Units available:millibars/hPa inches of mercury aka Hg or inches Hcentigrade/celsius and FahrenheitYou might also be looking for: luxmeter, lightmeter, light meter, magnetometer, barometer, hygrometer, accelerometer, thermometer ... if your phone has it, WeatherSignal reads it, graphs it, maps it, saves it.

Unlike regular programs they don't just install themselves in the application tray so you have to add them manually. They will not open or launch.Here's how to add a widget on your Android home screen.STEPS HOW TO ADD A WIDGET==========================1.On your Android home screen, tap any blank or \u201cempty\u201d area with size 4x1 and hold down your finger.2.An \u201cAdd to Home screen\u201d window will pop up. From that window, tap \u201cWidgets\u201d.3.You\u2019ll be presented with a list of all the installed Widgets on your Android device.4.Select the clock to add to your home screen by tapping it.Notes=====\"Time frozen/not updating\"-> taskiller killed the clock(exclude it from taskillers)When phone starts, clock starts in less than a min too.ROM users-> make sure the clock is NOT moved on SD card.Widgets are not supposed to be on SD card. Move it back to the phone storage.Weather hint: For world destinations with two words in the name, type in the box the words with a plus sign.For example \"Buenos Aires\" type \"Buenos+Aires\",remember the \"+\" sign -no spaces, don't include the quotes.Email problems/suggestionsCheck our website for more help.EXCLUDE IT FROM TASKILLERS!!!Be polite, this is a free app :-)VIDEO HOW TO ADD WIDGETShttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpMLF9b2aTQ  ", "content_rating": "Everyone", "reviewers": "1111", "operating_system": "2.3 and up", "developer": "Factory Widgets", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://fatorywidgets.blogspot.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNH9zVocrH7-DR9wL9hgVhrmtChidQ", "title": "Sense Analog Small Black 4x1", "email": "harisdotdot@gmail.com", "rating": "4.170154571533203", "date_published": "September 6, 2014", "category": "Weather", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Factory+Widgets"}

If permission is granted to determine user\u2019s location, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind direction and speed, as well as weather photograph collected from nearby weather stations will be displayed. \u201cMy Location Settings\u201d is introduced since version 4.0.0. In the \u201cMy Location Settings\u201d, users can opt for using the automatic location service provided by the smartphone, or designating \u201cMy Location\u201d on the map themselves.  This location will be displayed on the main page and in \u201cMy Weather Report\u201d.  The meteorological data displayed on the same page is provided by meteorological stations nearby, and is not necessarily from a station in the same region. In case meteorological data is not available from nearby stations, data from other meteorological stations at headquarter of the Observatory, King\u2019s Park, and Star Ferry will be used instead.  Meanwhile, \u201cHong Kong Observatory\u201d will be used as \u201cMy Location\u201d.Please note that:1.\tAlthough the \u201cMyObservatory\u201d is a free app, user will be charged by their mobile network service provider on the use of data service. These charges can become very expensive on roaming. Please ensure that the option of \u201cData Roaming\u201d have been disabled in the settings of your mobile devices.  Meanwhile, the app requires user\u2019s authorization on: \u201cfull network access\u201d, \u201cview network connections\u201d, \u201cview Wi-Fi connections\u201d to download weather data over the Internet.2.\tThe estimated location provided by the mobile device may be deviated from your actual location. Meanwhile, owing to the dissimilarity in altitude and topography between user\u2019s location and weather station, weather information displayed may be different from the actual conditions.3.\tUse of location-based rain forecast notification will increase the battery usage and data download.4.\tTo allow user to get hold to important weather information such as weather warning, Special Weather Tips, location-based rain forecast, etc., the \u201cMyObservatory\u201d would automatically notify users the above information according to user\u2019s settings.  This feature requires user\u2019s authorization on \u201crun at startup\u201d.

SailGrib WR uses regular Maxsea polar files (.pol extension)SailGrib WR includes a set of more than 100 polar files for different sailboats.- wind limits up and downwind- minimum upwind angle for comfort while cruising- night efficiency loss for cruising- mixed routing: use your engine if you are too slow sailing.- the current grib fileImportant note:Grib files are computer-generated forecast files which are sent without review, and are offered on an as-is basis.

These figures may vary, particularly if there is inversion, etc. It is important to always remember that Meteoservis exclusively presents the weather forecast.Selected properties:\u2022 Minimal to negligible data demands in the hundreds of units of kB and thus very cheap operation even if the connection via GPRS / EDGE.\u2022 Detailed display of predictions. Weather and temperature are available at three-hour intervals, so you always have a complete overview of how the weather will probably change throughout the day or night.\u2022 Displays the amount of rainfall in a given interval and atmospheric pressure.\u2022 Graphical overview of the weather for the next 5 days with the process temperature, etc.\u2022 Windchill / Heat index.

Whether you are sailing, motor yachting or doing other water sport activities, you can configure \u201cYachting Weather\u201d exactly to your needs with numerous options. The forecasts for the next three days come in six hour intervals (for five days in three hour intervals with \u201cYachting Weather PRO\u201d) and are available worldwide. Due to the high spatial resolution of 0,15\u00b0 to 0,25\u00b0 (which is comparable to approx.12x12 sea miles). Conventional GFS weather models work with a resolution of 0,5\u00b0 to 1\u00b0 and assume equal weather conditions for a sea area of 60 x 60 nautical miles. On open sea or nearby the coastline a high resolution forecast for wind and waves can be advantageous. Changing winds, gusts or rough sea within short distances could be missed by large scale forecast models. Besides a higher spatial resolution WEATHER365 weather models  integrate topographical, geographical and vegetal characteristics - especially of the coastal areas - which have influence on weather trends and weather evolution. Even bathymetry data are included because of their impact on wave height and length. You receive exact predictions for your designated position.All weather data are  based on optimized WRF and Wave Watch III weather models and calculated and updated four times a day by WEATHER365.

Novice users benefit from the automated nature of the app, while intermediate to advanced users can enjoy an abundance of data at their fingertips.Features:- Automatically alerts when auroral activity is high enough- Current auroral activity based on Kp and history graphs- Auroral oval map customized for all locations- NOAA Kp predictions within the next few hours- 3-day aurora forecast- Solar wind and IMF data- Configure when you can be alerted based on sky darkness- Filter out alerts based on current cloud cover- Several local K-indices available for the most up-to-date activity- Moon phase calendar includedWhen first launching Aurora Alert, it will find your location from GPS or cell networks, and then configure your settings based on the results. Users can then adjust any settings, if they wish. Aurora Alert will then update in the background, as often as you wish, and will alert you to possible aurora sightings when the conditions are favorable. You\u2019ll never miss a chance to see the northern lights again!Aurora Alert is configured to run as efficiently as possible. Automatic updates will download only 5KB of compressed data per update, which spares users of downloading needless data against their limits. It also runs only when it needs to, and no more, which helps save battery life and frees up for RAM for other apps. Note that since Aurora Alert needs to update in the background, certain task killer apps can prevent it from updating. So if you run any task killers, Aurora Alert will need to be on the ignore list in order to keep updating.For more screenshots, see the website link below.  Your feedback would be appreciated.

A first of its kind Android app that lets you measure temperature and humidity readings. No more having to rely on online weather reports or even the news. Use Thermo and turn your phone into a thermometer. ImportantThis application relies on thermometer/ambient temperature sensor present on your device. Please check the manual and ensure your device is equipped with a thermometer before purchasing it.Thermo works on any device that has an inbuilt thermometer. Simply download the app and install it to convert your phone into a temperature sensor device. Measure temperature in Fahrenheit or Celcius at any point of time and across time intervals. You can also add a description to each reading, which can later be used for filtering the readings. You can also monitor the temperature over a period of time and log various readings under a heading, allowing you to track changes in the temperature. The app also lets you view the log in a graphical manner. The graph, combined with filtering, offers a powerful tool for tracking temperature changes. Thermo for Galaxy S4 reads and reports ambient humidity as well. It uses Galaxy S4 inbuilt humid sensor to measure humidity. And once you\u2019ve done that you can share your location and your reading instantly on to your favourite social network, Facebook. Your post would be geo-tagged as well! The app also has a calibration option that can be customized by you for your phone. You can offset any errors in temperature reading due the sensor inaccuracy, influence of heated battery or phone case you may be using.What\u2019s more there\u2019s a home screen widget that lets you quickly view the current room temperature. This widget has been developed efficiently to consume the least amount of battery possible. You have an option to automatically add log from widget. Please set a log title in the settings screen to enable this feature.

Weather Alert & Weather Alarm.OnGuard Weather Alerts monitors the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) active weather alerts for advisories, watches, and warnings for your location (Within the Continental United States. Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico).When an alert is detected for your current location or any of your static location entries, an appropriate audible, sensory (vibrate), and visual alert will be generated depending on the severity of the NOAA alert type (Advisory, Watch, or Warning).Weather Alert & Weather Alarm.Features:- NO Signups, NO Websites, NO text messages, and NO ads! This application runs entirely on your Android device as a background service and pulls alerts directly from the source (NOAA).- NOAA provides advisories, watches, and warnings for: Severe Storms, Tornadoes, Wildfires, Earthquakes, Winter Weather, Extreme Temperatures, Tropical Storms, Hurricanes, Typhoons, Volcanoes, Tsunami, Wind, 911 Outages, Fog, Flooding, Civil Emergencies, Nuclear Power Plant Warnings, Law Enforcement Warnings, Local Emergencies, Child Abduction Emergencies, Avalanches, and more.- Dynamic Location Support (uses GPS or Cell Network location determination).- Dynamic Location feature is on/off configurable.- Static Location Support (unlimited # of entries).- Audible, Sensory (vibrate), and Visual alerts (Configurable).-  User customizable alert sounds.- Insistent Alert Support (off/on configurable) for Warning level events (ie. Audible, Sensory, and Visual alerts will repeat until acknowledged).- Filtering of Alerts by category. *NEW* (in the 06/03/2011 release).- Configurable Notification Levels (Warnings Only, Watches & Warnings, Advisories & Watches & Warnings).- Configurable interval for checking for alerts.- \"Check Now\" Button for manual or instant checks.- Easily stop the service by simple unchecking a box in the preferences.- Link to context sensitive tips from FEMA detailing information about what to do before, during, and after certain events. (In the main menu - full list of events, In the alert detail menu - contect specific information).- Link to the \"Red Cross Safe & Well Check In\" site (This is the site to report that you are OK after a disaster or to locate a loved one that was in a disaster).In Development:- Radar & Weather Radio Mode currently work, we are waiting for tablet integration before release.- Various other improvements to existing functionality.FAQ:Q: Is OnGuard hard on my battery?A: No. The application minimizes the amount of power required by allowing the user to control whether Dynamic Location is enabled. Even with this feature enabled, the app only requests Dynamic Location updates at the same interval as your alert polling interval.Q: How much data is used?A: Not much at all. It varies based upon the number of active weather publications and how frequently you configure the application to check for updates. Each time the app checks for new NOAA publications a 2k (kilobyte) data packet is retrieved via the Internet for each location configured in your preferences. Using the default app settings, approximately 200k (kilobytes) per day or 6M (megabytes) per month of data is used. This is a very small amount given the allowances of most provider's data plans.Tip: If data usage is a concern, consider disabling the background service and using the Check Now feature instead.Q. I am getting alerts for an incorrect location.A. If you are using \"Dynamic Location\", sometimes the cell network location (used when GPS is unavailable) will return an incorrect location. This is cell tower issue and is outside our control. Please obtain a GPS fix or use a static location entry.Q. I am having an issue after updating, what should I do?A. If you are experiencing any issues after an update, please uninstall and re-install the application.

(Market->My Apps->ColdSnap!->My Review / Rate It!)Who's it for?ColdSnap! Frost Alarm is a must have application for gardeners, allotment holders and anyone else that wants a low maintenance, light weight frost warning system.I produced the application specifically to warn myself of impending low temperatures having had our permaculture project in 2010 suffer frost damage as a result of a late frost. ColdSnap! is not intended to be a full blown weather app and does not replace your existing weather application or widgets. It is a lightweight application that, once installed and configured, you never need look at again. Rely on ColdSnap! to check the forecast even when you forget. I use it myself, so you can be sure it\u2019ll continue to be maintained.ColdSnap! is perfect for all outdoor pursuits, ideal for fair-weather sailors planning a sailing weekend, fair-weather campers planning a camping trip, those with animals, livestock and poultry that need protection from low temperatures. Protect those precious grape vines! If you're an amateur viticulturist like me, this is a must have app if you need reminding to cover up to save those first shoots of the year! Farmers, drivers, rail companies, facilities managers, estate managers can all benefit! Having commuted into London for many years, how I wished my rail operator had been forewarned of ice on the track What's it for?ColdSnap! Frost Alarm is a simple but effective way to ensure you are notified of low temperatures forecast in your area.What's it do?Nothing...until you need it to! ColdSnap! Frost Alarm will periodically check the weather forecast and produce notifications whenever a low temperature is forecast. Once the app has been run once, you never need look at it again. You can rely on ColdSnap! to do the checking. ColdSnap! will even restart automatically if you restart your mobile, so months down the line when you've forgotten to keep an eye on the forecast, rest assured that ColdSnap! hasn't.

This algorithm allows to filter out most of sounds, so that human voice, ornoise of trees on the wind do not affect measurement accuracy.Before starting to use anemometer please set zero wind level: hold your device in silent no-wind conditionsand press \"Set zero\" item in menu. The value will be stored in persistent memory, so you don't need todo it often. However, if you feel that zero level is wrong for some reason - just re-do it.New method of anemometer calibration is added:put phone side by side with the reference anemometer instrument to a constant air flow, click on Menu-Calibration Point and enter wind speed, measuredby reference device. Calibration constant will be re-calculated automatically.When the anemometer is stopped measured data is saved to file (10 points per second).

The weather routing I used was Sailgrib. I found the gribs and routing very accurate. It was also very simple to work and therefore did not need to spend lots of time at a computer like my opposition would have had to. I used the sony waterproof Android Tablet on wifi aboard. My only failings in the race was when I did not take the routing advice givern by Sailgrib WR. If I did all the time, I would have done better!I can recommend it.http://yolo-sa6130.blogspot.com/SailGrib WR is a sailing weather routing app.It calculates the fastest sailing route to your destination along a route with waypoints.Before you purchase this app, it is highly recommended that you try the free version which is fully functional but limited to :- requesting and viewing only the next 48 hours forecast- calculating an unlimited amount of routes of  50NM or less.- calculating 10 routes between 50 an 150NM.In SailGrib WR, you can specify amongst other parameters:- the wind grib file: SailGrib WR includes the regular SailGrib features.- the start, the destination points and intermediary waypoints- the departure date and time,- the speed polar file of your boat. SailGrib WR uses regular Maxsea polar files (.pol extension)SailGrib WR includes a set of more than 100 polar files for different sailboats.- wind limits up and downwind- minimum upwind angle for comfort while cruising- night efficiency loss for cruising- mixed routing: use your engine if you are too slow sailing.- the current grib fileImportant note:Grib files are computer-generated forecast files which are sent without review, and are offered on an as-is basis. There is no assurance that the data is accurate or correct. By using such data, you acknowledge and agree to these limitations.The weather routing module is for planning purpose only and should not be used for navigation.

Note that, although the meteogram has the appearance of those generated by yr.no, unlike other similar apps out there, this app does *not* just fetch the latest pre-generated meteogram image from yr.no and display that.Instead, raw weather data is fetched from yr.no and a meteogram is generated from that data.  This produces a very crisp and clean-looking meteogram, and allows interactive features such as what happens when you click on a time point.As I develop the app I plan to add more functionality, and your feedback or suggestions would be very welcome.  If you have any issues, please email me so that I can fix it, rather than leave negative feedback.  Thank you!Finally, thanks to Alessio Atzeni (www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons) for the icon.

No problem! SunnyDay can take any location name (e.g. - City, State, Zip Code, etc.) and pull the weather for it. In this mode you will get a forecast for the next day and a quick link to the google weather page for your location for more detailed weather information.If you have a different weather station and would like SunnyDay to support it, contact us at support@bullercodeworks.com and, if we can, we'll work with you to add support!-- NOTICE FOR NON-US USERS --If you are using Yahoo as your weather source, then you need to input a Weather Location Code. I'm working on building in lookup support for these codes into the app, but until I get that completed, you will need to find the appropriate Location Code for your area. Here is a site that will help you:http://edg3.co.uk/snippets/weather-location-codes/   * Add as many widgets as you want, choosing between Yahoo Weather or a WeatherLink Station for each. Data displayed in the detail view varies depending on the data available per source.   * Custom location names for your widget. Added your source but want the widget to show something other than your City and State or the WeatherLink station name? No problem.   * Decide whether you want to display High/Low temperature information on the widget.   * Use Light Text or Dark Text to make the widget easier to see depending on your wallpaper.   * Widget can be re-customized easily, as well as resized in newer versions of Android. No need to destroy and recreate the widget just to make a simple change.Why make another weather widget?I was tired of downloading apps to simply display the weather as a widget and receiving 37 other un-wanted widgets in my widget selector. I like to keep my phone clean. Also there were no widgets that display data from a WeatherLink station.Questions, comments, or bug reports?

The affordable units are:Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees (for the temperature)A percentage (Humidity)Millibars, millimeters or inches of mercury (The atmospheric pressure) The data value can be rounded to the nearest whole.You can turn on or turn off the animation. The most important thing in design was the widget's \"lightness\" for easy information reading and, at the same time, did not have to take a lot of useful  space  of the desktop. That's why I used the clear glass imitation for the ClimatSens visualisation.Due to this, the widget looks good on any desktop wallpaper.

{"app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tyrell.vintagebarometer", "price": "EGP7.54", "Description": " The barometer is a scientific instrument used in meteorology for more than three centuries to measure atmospheric pressure. By tracking changes in pressure it is possible to predict the weather with some accuracy. Now you can use your Android device as a barometer with this unique new app!The classic weather forecast instrument is now available on ALL Android devices!Vintage Barometer uses up-to-the-minute data from World Weather Online to create an authentic antique barometer experience. Watch as the pressure rises and falls to gauge what weather is on its way. If the pressure is rising, the weather should be improving - if it's falling you might want to find your umbrella.Giovanni Grigioni was one of the great makers of barometers in the Victorian era, a tradition upheld by three generations of the Grigioni family. Vintage Barometer was created by Giovanni's great-great-grandson, so it seemed only right to revive this classic barometer marque for the 21st century. The barometer dial is in the aneroid style, set on a background of dark red mahogany, with a brass boilerplate featuring the manufacturer's details, and a marquetry motif including the Tyrell electric sheep logo.If you've been eyeing up the new generation of smartphones and tablets with built-in barometers (Samsung Galaxy Note, Galaxy S3 (SGS3), Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Xoom and Sony Ericsson Active, etc) fear not! You too can have a barometer in your current Android device: at a fraction of the price of a new phone ;)How to use Vintage BarometerBy checking Vintage Barometer on a daily basis, you can predict the weather with some accuracy. The barometer gives a reading of atmospheric pressure; by observing how the pressure changes over time, it is possible to build up your own weather forecast. The text on the dial of a barometer (rain, changeable, sunny and so on) only gives a generalisation and is mostly decorative.In general:~ rising pressure means more settled and clear weather is on its way.~ falling pressure means less settled, cloudier weather is coming, with the possibility of rain.The rate at which the pressure is rising or falling is also important:~ if the pressure rises gradually over a period of time (1-5 mb per day for a week or so) this is an indication of a long period of settled clear weather to come.~ if the pressure falls slowly, a long period of unsettled, changeable weather can be expected.~ if the barometer falls very quickly (10 - 20mb in a few hours), there is a storm on the way. Strong winds and rain should be expected.~ rapidly rising pressure means improving conditions and clearing skies.As Admiral Fitzroy (famous meteorologist and Captain of The Beagle during Darwin's voyage, who pioneered modern weather forecasting techniques) said, \u201clong foretold, long last; short notice, soon past\u201d. If you happen to be a fan of the BBC Shipping Forecast, you will now be able to understand why you hear things like \u201c1028, rising slowly\u201d.

It's not just about the category or a point on a map - you'll understand what to expect and then we will take you there with our field mission reports and live weather data and web cam images. * During our field missions Hurricane Impact will be an excellent resource for users to know what is going on with our \"boots on the ground\" field updates.

This was a very successful part of our initial launch last hurricane season with over 40 video blogs delivered to the app from the landfall zone during hurricanes Isaac and Sandy. * We have developed our own tracking maps as well as specialized Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential tracking maps that not only plot the current and forecast positions of storms and hurricanes, but also give the user the added benefit of seeing the upper ocean heat content along the forecast path. Only Hurricane Impact has this feature! * Our Twitter and Facebook updates are posted in the app for easy following of our social media interaction. URLs open just by tapping them from within the app - a nice feature to view pics as we post them. * We also cover off-season weather such as winter storms, severe weather threats and more.

{"app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinhinds.riseandset", "price": "EGP7.00", "Description": " Explore our world from space!  What part of the Earth is illuminated by the sun?  What's the current Moon phase?  How does the Earth look from the Moon?Features include:* Three exciting widgets to view the Earth and Moon from space in real time* Sun Rise / Sun Set information* Amount of daylight / darkness for given day on Earth* Moon Rise / Moon Set information* Custom location based results[Specific times for Sun/Moon rise and Sun/Moon set information is available for US cities only]Viewing Earth from the Moon    Looking at the Earth from the Moon, it's a relatively small, blue sphere.  Because the Moon doesn't rotate, you have to be on the right side of the Moon to see the Earth at all.  If you're on the side of the Moon that can see the Earth, it would be in your sky all day and night.  The Earth stay in the sky but would wax and wane, just as the Moon does as seen from our world. So considering how memorizing people can find a full Moon, how would a bright full Earth look on the Moon?  From the Moon, the Earth would be about 3.7 times bigger in diameter.  The Earth has a diameter of 7926 miles, compared to the Moon's only 2159 mile diameter.  The hardest thing to simulate is the difference in brightness.  People lucky enough to walk on the Moon in our times have noticed a very striking phenomenon, a full Earth from the Moon appears much larger and is much brighter.  It's true that a full Moon can appear very bright due to its surface (composed of rather reflective yet dull gray dust), however, the Earth has white clouds, oceans and polar ice caps which can reflect much more light that the Moon does.  Remember, the Earth and the Moon do not give off they're own light, rather it's reflecting the sun's light. Earth and Moon phase    Earth and Moon phases are direct opposites of each other, basically they appear as the other one does only in reverse.  When we would see a nearly full Moon, people on the Moon would see a slim crescent Earth.  The next time you see a crescent Moon from Earth, imaging people on the Moon seeing a nearly full Earth hanging in the lunar sky.  Just like the Moon, Earth also goes through a cycle of phases over the period of a month, you will (from the Moon) witness a Full Earth, Gibbous Earth, Quarter Earth, Crescent Earth, and New Earth.  The Moon always keeps one side  (called the Near Side) facing Earth as it orbits around us, hence, depending on your location, Earth would always appear in the exact same place in the night sky.  If you were standing in the middle of the near side of the Moon, Earth would appear directly overhead.  If you are on the far side of the Moon, you would never see the Earth because that side of the Moon will never rotate to turn twoards Earth.  If you were to walk to a place between the near and far sides of the Moon, the Earth would be \"frozen\" or about in a state of being \"half-risen\" on the Moon's horizon. Measuring Albedo    The property of Earth's brightness when viewing from the Moon is a matter of Albedo or a measure of reflectivity of celestial bodies.  Earth has an average Albedo of 0.367 or 36.7% of sunlight reflecting from it.  The Moon has 0.12 or 12% Albedo.  Earth is 3 times brighter than the Moon.  Astronauts that walking on the Moon say that \"Earth-shine\" is so bright that it's almost like daytime.  When the angles of the Earth and the Moon are right, the Earth's oceans act like a mirror, much like those garden globes that act like small ball shaped mirrors in your garden.  From the Moon, you can see a mirror image of the sun reflecting off one of Earth's oceans.  This makes Earth-shine view much more bright, colorful and interesting rather than watching Moonshine from Earth.  We can certainly see how much Earth-gazing will be popular among the first Moon colonies.Keywords:Earth, Moon, Space, Sun, Rise and Set, Daylight, Darkness, Day, Night  ", "content_rating": "Everyone", "reviewers": "2", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "developer": "Kevin Hinds", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bitstreetapps.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEY5_b16OSetuG57UbjOgy1Zigh_A", "title": "Earth, Sun and Moon", "email": "kevin@bitstreetapps.com", "rating": "2.5", "date_published": "July 9, 2013", "category": "Weather", "downloads": "100 - 500", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Kevin+Hinds"}

Push notification function is also available, providing real-time information directly to your phone, sometimes within seconds of initial tremors! This is the donate version of the app that is AD-FREE, slightly smaller in size and will get updates earlier than the free version. Feel free to purchase this version if you think that this app is helpful and would like to support us.CORE FEATURES:1. Information is given predominantly in English. User reports from Japanese sources are translated where possible. 2. Push notification option, which provides a quick alert to your phone status bar when initial tremors are reported at the epicenter. 3. Fast (sometimes within seconds of first tremors). This is because information is not solely from JMA (which usually has a 5 mins delay), but also from social media and other firsthand sources around Japan. Frequency of update is 10 seconds.4. Links to detailed information (intensity, magnitude, coordinates, etc.) and maps are provided and can be browsed within the app itself. These are mostly in English as well.5. Simple, compact and fuss-free user interface.-------------------------NOTE TO USER-------------------------You may notice that several permissions are required. Internet and Network permissions are understandable as the information is real-time. The other permissions pertain primarily to the C2D messaging (a.k.a push notification) by Google. Note that the notification option can be turned OFF.Where possible, translations have been made. This is an ongoing work so do expect a little Japanese slipping in here and there in the reports. As some of the information are obtained from social media or user reports, accuracy of the reports may vary, particularly for very early warnings.

This application is an ALERT Notification system for individuals to send to their family, friends and emergency professionals to be able to locate you FOLLOWING an incident. Following the Moore Oklahoma tornadoes, it was reported by the American Red Cross that many individuals said they did not take shelter because they were afraid that nobody would find them. Also people didn\u2019t know exactly where their children at school or other family members actually went to take cover. The FIND ME \u2013 Tornado Safety App , once activated by the individual, will alert (via text, email and phone message) a pre-determined list of contacts that shelter has been taken. The application will in a future update also be synced to Facebook and Twitter to make posts to general audiences. With the push of one icon on the mobile device, FIND ME will register the last known GPS Location of the individual, as well as a custom input of a specific location within the structure where shelter has been taken. While this Application is primarily a notification tool for the Individual and family and friends during a tornado, there is a larger scale function of this application if overlaid with a product such as ESRI\u2019s Community Software. If community first responders, State Emergency Management or FEMA utilizes the ESRI Community software during an active tornado, the FIND ME \u2013Tornado Safety App is overlaid on this software , officials could see immediately where people have taken shelter and could be trapped and need rescuing.No subscription charges!

The altimeter displays the current weather, the sea level barometer reading, the pressure sensor reading, the pressure altitude, and the change in altitude since the last 'zero' setting.Tapping the top left corner information display will reset the Zero Setting.Tapping the center Pressure Altitude display will re-sample the current barometric reading.Sync, Database, Help, About, and Settings are available on the Action Bar.The Barometer Monitor collects the current weather conditions, sea level barometer reading, and the phone's barometer reading. The data is saved to a database every 15 minutes. The database can be 'dumped' to a CSV or SQL file which can be uploaded to your computer. The file can then be processed with a spreadsheet or database program.The Barometer Control and Display screen graphically displays the last 200 samples. When the sample count exceeds 200, the last 200 are initially displayed. To display earlier samples, swipe (scroll)the display horizontally. -- The Altimeter --The altimeter will show your pressure altitude, change in altitude, and current weather conditions. Set the zero point before you ride an elevator or climb a hill and see your change in altitude.The altimeter displays:- The sensor pressure reading in hectopascals and inches of mercury.- A zero setting used to calculate changes in altitude.- Pressure Altitude in feet or meters.- Change in altitude from the zero point in feet or meters.- Current weather conditions for your location- Humidity percentage.- Cloud cover percentage.- Wind speed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour.- Wind direction as compass points and degrees.- Visibility in miles or kilometers.- Barometric sea level. -- The Barometer Pressure Sensor Monitor --The Barometer data collected by the monitor is graphically displayed on the Monitor Database and Control screen. The screen has 3 control functions:- Start the monitor- Stop the monitor- Dump the database to a CSV or SQL fileThe Barometer Monitor runs in the background building an SQLite database of samples every quarter hour. Once started, the monitor will run until stopped. If the phone is restarted or turned off and on, the monitor will restart.The Barometer Monitor is battery and data friendly. The monitor battery use is less than 1%. Internet data is less than 1000 bytes of data per sample. Running 24/7, that is less than 100 kilobytes a day.The monitor can dump the database to a file on your SD card. The file can be uploaded from your phone to a computer. The dump file record format can be either CSV or SQL.The CSV format can be processed by a spreadsheet program.The SQL format can be used to build an SQLite database. By editing the CREATE statement at the head of the SQL data, you can load the data into other database types such as MySQL.The database is stored on public storage on your phone. If you have SQLite capabilities on your computer, you can copy the SQLite database without the need to dump it to SQL. The native SQLite database is compatible with SQLite on your laptop or desktop computer.-- File Names --Database: galaxyabw_barometer.dbCSV: galaxyabw_barometer_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS.CSVSQL: balaxyabw_barometer_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS.SQLYYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS is the numerical year, month, day, hour, minute, and second that the file was created.-- Crittercism --Critercism has been removed.-- Disclaimer --The pressure sensor in the Galaxy phone is not a laboratory or aircraft quality sensor. Measurements between your phone and an aircraft altimeter or laboratory quality device will differ significantly. Measurements between phones may differ significantly. That said, the values captured on the same phone are reasonably accurate in relation to each other.
