If you take pictures in daylight, you may be satisfied with the quality of mobile images. However, when you move to a less bright indoor environment, you start to notice the difference. Mobile images appear to have more noise, they are usually blurry and lack detail in shadows. Bright areas turn into pure-white spots. Faces seem unnaturally flat, especially when using a flash. Getting into a darker environment extends the gap. While images taken with a regular camera are not very good but still do show a scene, mobile images become unacceptably blurry and show almost nothing but smeared lights and the camera\u2019s own noise.Almalence, Inc. has developed a technology that combines a special exposure mode and software post-processing to greatly reduce the blur effects and improve dynamic range.===FAQQ: Isn't it better to use the standard camera and then improve the photos in Photoshop?A: It is always better to take a quality image than to improve a bad one. It is usually impossible to remove heavy blur or reduce high noise without losing image details.Night Camera does not apply deblurring or noise reduction filters to a standard image, it gets a better image from the sensor.

Join us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/mobilehdr and on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/groups/1820156@N20Why HDR------------Real life scenes often have a wide range of light intensity, which cannot be captured by a camera. In a photo of such a scene the bright areas look washed out and everything in shadows is pictured as a black spot with no details. The HDR technique allows you to capture details in bright and dark areas and have them merged in a single photo.HDR photography is widely adopted by professional photographers. Wouldn't it be nice to have an HDR in mobile phones?The problem is that HDR requires taking several differently exposed images in series, which must be precisely aligned and then fused. In order to be usable for real life scenes, the HDR feature should include moving object detection and hand shake compensation to avoid or minimize the ghosting in the final image. That requires a lot of computational resources and makes a challenge even for professional desktop HDR software.Almalence has brought its expertise in professional HDR software to mobile phones. Our HDR fusion algorithms compensate hand shaking and detect moving objects in the scene, suppressing ghosting artifacts. At the same time, the algorithms are quick enough to provide comfortable processing time on mobile devices.Additional info and facts* Available for iOS/iPhone/iPad as well.* Human eye has a built-in HDR-like processing which increases effective dynamic range nearly 10,000 times!* Painters such as van Gogh used techniques similar to Tone Mapping  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almalence.hdr", "price": "0", "date_published": "January 13, 2014", "email": "support@mobilehdr.almalence.com", "downloads": "1,000,000 - 5,000,000", "category": "Photography", "developer": "Almalence", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Almalence/459753787388980&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFwvDuQVu8qdczcFNaHByIpOZge2g", "reviewers": "21369"}

This app was a modification of the stock app and i wont add features. The Xperia PLAY camera doesn't support zoom anyway so it's pointless digital zoom is just cropping so go do it in the gallery. You'd just all complain the zoom quality was bad, you'd be better off drawing it than digital zoom!

In a photo of such a scene the bright areas look washed out and everything in shadows is pictured as a black spot with no details. The HDR technique allows you to capture details in bright and dark areas and have them merged in a single photo.HDR photography is widely adopted by professional photographers. Wouldn't it be nice to have an HDR in mobile phones?The problem is that HDR requires taking several differently exposed images in series, which must be precisely aligned and then fused. In order to be usable for real life scenes, the HDR feature should include moving object detection and hand shake compensation to avoid or minimize the ghosting in the final image. That requires a lot of computational resources and makes a challenge even for professional desktop HDR software.Almalence has brought its expertise in professional HDR software to mobile phones. Our HDR fusion algorithms compensate hand shaking and detect moving objects in the scene, suppressing ghosting artifacts. At the same time, the algorithms are quick enough to provide comfortable processing time on mobile devices.

From the team that created Pro HDR for iOS, now you can automatically create stunning full-resolution HDR images with just a single tap on your Android phone. Please note that this app has been tested to work properly on Motorola, HTC and most Samsung phones. However, if you have a LG, Sony, or other device, the HDR capability may not function properly. Full functionality has been verified on the following phones:* HTC: Thunderbolt, EVO 4G, MyTouch 4G, G2, Incredible, Desire, Legend, Bravo* Motorola: Droid, Droid 2, Droid X* Samsung: Galaxy S, Epic 4G, Galaxy NexusHere are a few professional reviews of our iPhone app Pro HDR:\"If you ever take photos using your iPhone, this app is a must-have.\" - Gizmodo\"Pro HDR leaps ahead of the pack... Even if you're not into HDR photography, this is one to check out.\" - TUAW\"Picture Perfection: Pro HDR automatically aligns and blends the images, giving you a perfectly exposed, amazing image that rivals a high-end point-and-shoot camera\" - NBC Los AngelesThanks to Pro HDR Camera, you no longer have to choose between a blown-out sky or a hopelessly dark foreground. Bringing automatic high dynamic range photography to your Android phone for the first time ever, Pro HDR captures an image exposed for the highlights and another exposed for the shadows. It then aligns and merges the images, giving you a gorgeous HDR image up to 8 megapixels like nothing you've ever seen from such a tiny device.Unlike fake HDR apps that merely take a single photo and reprocess it (without actually adding any new detail), Pro HDR massively extends the dynamic range of your camera and produces beautiful results that you have to see to believe. We provide a fully automatic mode, and an assisted Manual mode for those times when you wish to choose your exact exposures. Finally, you can take stunning high-res photos of all those scenes that are just too contrasty to capture in a single picture.Not only will seasoned photographers instantly fall in love with Pro HDR, one look at our example images should convince anyone that Pro HDR represents a new era in mobile photography.

What are the problems taking good quality pictures with camera phones and is there a way to solve them and bridge the gap between camera phones and compact cameras?You may think there is very little difference between a cell phone camera and a point-and-shoot camera. Nowadays, mobile phone cameras have enough megapixels. The phones have enough storage capacity. Even the lens quality is not as bad as before and can compete with low-end compact cameras.At the same time, a big gap still exists when it comes to the basis of photography \u2013 the light source. If you take pictures in daylight, you may be satisfied with the quality of mobile images. However, when you move to a less bright indoor environment, you start to notice the difference. Mobile images appear to have more noise, they are usually blurry and lack detail in shadows. Bright areas turn into pure-white spots. Faces seem unnaturally flat, especially when using a flash. Getting into a darker environment extends the gap. While images taken with a regular camera are not very good but still do show a scene, mobile images become unacceptably blurry and show almost nothing but smeared lights and the camera\u2019s own noise.Almalence, Inc. has developed a technology that combines a special exposure mode and software post-processing to greatly reduce the blur effects and improve dynamic range.===FAQQ: Isn't it better to use the standard camera and then improve the photos in Photoshop?A: It is always better to take a quality image than to improve a bad one. It is usually impossible to remove heavy blur or reduce high noise without losing image details.Night Camera does not apply deblurring or noise reduction filters to a standard image, it gets a better image from the sensor.

{"title": "iWatermark", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Plum+Amazing", "rating": "4.113821029663086", "Description": " \u2605The essential Watermarking App for Photo Pros, Business and Personal Use\u2605 iWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms Android, iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most advanced utility for creating watermarks and watermarking photos. Easily secure and protect your photos/art with a visible text or graphic or QR watermark. Once added to a photo this visible watermark displays your creation and ownership. Watermarking is increasingly important and like signing your name to a photo to subtly display, no matter where your photo goes, that its yours. Watermarking can also be used to add a personal message or fun graphics to any photo. Thanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. We promise as Android evolves iWatermark will evolve. Touch is what Android is all about. With iWatermark you can: \u2666 With your finger click on the watermark to move it around on the page. \u2666 Create your own text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics). \u2666 Single or batch process many photos at a time.\u2666 Choose from the 157 fonts\u2666 Use pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \u2666 Touch with two fingers at once and rotate to rotate the watermark. \u2666 By touch easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color and angle. Create your own watermark or use our included examples. Examples are both text (names, dates, etc) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. Create your own text watermarks using any the Android fonts directly in iWatermark. Or you can import your own graphic watermarks to expand the range of possibilities. These can be signatures or logos which are made on your computer (which has more fonts and abilities, see FAQ below for more details) and then synched over via email and saved to the photo library. A newer type of graphic watermark you can make directly in iWatermark is a QR code which is like a barcode. QR codes are very familiar to most Android users. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. Using QR codes as watermarks is one of iWatermarks unique and useful features.Why Watermark? Digitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation. \u2714 Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images. \u2714 Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks. \u2714 Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad. \u2714 Avoid the conflicts and headaches with plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it. \u2714 Avoid the costly litigation that can be involved in these cases of misuse of ip. \u2714 Avoid intellectual property squabbles. Q: I want to use my signature as the visible watermark for my photos. How do I add graphic signature like the examples by Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? A: To do that you need to make the .png graphics on your computer,  save the png graphics direct to the phone storage or.email it to yourself, open the email on your phone and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.More details are in the manual: http://www.plumamazing.com//android/iwatermark/iwatermarkhelpIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there for fun and as examples to show what is possible.

{"title": "White Balance Color Temp Meter", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Folkstedt", "rating": "3.682539701461792", "Description": " Have you ever experienced that the colors of your photos does not seems to correspond to the colors of the scenes in front of you? Let this app help you to get more realistic and better looking photos!The app measures the color temperature of the lighting so that you can set the appropriate white balance setting on your camera. Problems have been reported on certain Android(TM) devices and therefore I now offer a MONEY BACK GUARANTEE - if you are not happy with the performance of the app on your device, let me know and I give you a full refund! Valid within a whole month from the date of purchase.How to Use the App?Find a surface that is white or gray. A white paper with or without text works perfectly. Just make sure to avoid any colors. Point the camera towards that surface and click the Analyze button. The app will then show the measured color temperature of the light that falls on that surface. The app will also recommend a white balance setting for you to use on your camera in these lighting conditions.What is Color Temperature?Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that measures the hue of light from a light source. Color temperatures are usually measured in Kelvin (K). Low color temperatures (below 3000 K) are called warm colors (red and yellowish white) while high color temperatures (above 5000 K) are called cool colors (blueish white). Technically the color temperature is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to that of the light source.When is Color Temperature Important?Color temperatures are of special interest in all kinds of color photography. The human eye easily compensates for the color temperature of different light sources. Most cameras today have a feature called Automatic White Balance, AWB, which tries to do the same. In some conditions this works OK, in other conditions the results are poor. Many photographers therefore prefer to manually set the white balance value on the camera to match the color temperature of the current scene. With this application you can measure the color temperature before doing the white balance setting on you camera to get a more accurate setting.You can also use this app to learn about the color temperatures in your environment. With this knowledge you can develop a better understanding of how the color temperatures varies which helps you when you are trying to master the light and colors in your photography.How Accurate are the Measurements?To measure the color temperature accurately is a complex issue. On an Android(TM) device is it complicated further by the fact that all devices are slightly different from each other. See the measured values as fairly good approximations.Got Feedback on the App?Please send any feedback, ideas or improvement suggestions on the application to folkstedt@gmail.com.

Panorama mode is free for HD Panorama+ users!Get A Better Camera NOW!High definition and fast panoramic camera:- Highest resolution- Fast and smooth panorama stitching- Easy to use- Augmented reality helps to get perfect panorama- Up to 360 degree panorama (only limited by available memory)Put your device in portrait orientation, tap shutter button, slowly sweep to the left or right, tap button again to stop shooting.Join HD Panorama fans and share your photos on facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hdpanoWhen shooting nature, camera optics rarely allow to capture complete landscape in it's beauty, not just chopping off small piece.Indoor, it is rarely possible to move far enough to cover the space completely. A number of frames has to be taken or special optics (fisheye) should be used.In these cases panorama is the solution.Usually, panorama on mobile devices is shoot using either of two methods:- sweep panorama - shooting is running continuously, and camera is rotated slowly and smoothly to capture entire scene.- pan-and-shoot panorama - multiple separate frames are shot: shoot - rotate - shoot - rotate, etc.Both cases have their own drawbacks.In case of sweep panorama the shooting is actually happening in video mode and the height of panorama is limited by maximum resolution for shooting video (for the majority of mobile devices it is 1280 pixels). Also, it is impossible to get sharp result under low-light illumination, since camera is always in movement, and exposure for each frame is rather long. On the other hand, on devices without gyroscope, sweep panorama usually will give better stitching results.Pan-and-shoot method allow to shoot panorama of maximum resolution, limited only by amount of available free memory on device. If device is equipped with gyro  - it is possible to rotate camera quickly from one shot to another. In this case it is also possible to select the most appropriate focusing mode: autofocus, focus to infinity, or continuous focusing.HD Panorama+ implements both shooting methods.One of the problems while shooting panorama - the necessity to strictly keep camera orientation to avoid distortion of horizon line, and to avoid 'curvature' on frame sequence. Otherwise only a narrow area will come out as a result of stitching. In HD Panorama+ there are 'augmented reality' guides. These are showing clearly how to orient camera to get ideal result. When using augmented reality - it is simply impossible to shoot the frame which will drop out of panorama line of sight.HD Panorama+ is stitching frames taking into account possible deviations in illumination between frames and presence of moving objects in panorama field. HD Panorama+ is reproducing dynamic range of the scene to the maximum extent and minimizing the moving objects stitching errors (ghosting removal).If you are a professional photographer, HD Panorama+ will allow to save the input frames captured, and stitch and possibly adjust them on your personal computer.For user convenience HD Panorama+ uses elements of Google Camera app UI under Apache license. Processing is done with proprietary Almalence algorithms, resulting in a drastic quality difference (highest resolution, dynamic range, etc).

{"title": "PlanIt! Pro for Photographers", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Ying+Wen+Technologies", "rating": "4.734375", "Description": " This is a special call to landscape photographers, travel photographers, nature photographers or those who are especially interested in night photography, skyline, time-lapse, star-trail and milky way or astrophotography: look no more, this is the ultimate app for you - the PlanIt! More video tutorials at http://youtu.be/CrtWDHNlwPA?list=PLTmlTTxPbBbeu8Yx4paLUytV8z60SSL_wAnsel Adams dedicates the beginning of his first book \"Taos Pueblo\" to visualization. He introduced the idea of \"previsualization\", which involved the photographer imagining what he wanted his final print to look like before he even took the shot. Of course there are many great photos which were taken impromptu. However, for landscape photographers, being able to previsualize the scene before going there will greatly reduce the chance of being caught unprepared and will greatly increase the chance of getting better shots. Photographers use various tools to help them pre-visualizing the scene. Nowadays, many of those tools are phone apps. PlanIt! is all-in-one solution that is designed to leverage the map and simulated viewfinder technologies (VR, AR etc.) to provide the necessary tools for photographers to pre-visualize the scene in combination with the Sun, Moon, Stars and Milky Way. Some questions that you might ask yourself before going out for a photographing trip are:* Where is the Sun or the Moon at the time and the location and to see the animation of the Sun/Moon/Stars/Milky Way movements as in real?* When and which azimuth is the Sunset or Sunrise today or on any date at any location around the world?* Where should I go to get a nice view of the scene and possible compositions? * Do I get a clear view of subject from a certain location where is no mountain blocking the view?* What lens should I bring in order to capture the whole width or the height of the scene? * If the scene is too wide, how many shots do I need to take to create a panorama and how many angle should each shot cover and how many angle should I rotate the camera between each shot?* How do I compose the scene considering the subject\u2019s elevation and the sun or moon location?* Is tonight a good time for star trail photography? How long can I exposure without being affected the rising moon? Where should I aim at the sky to get the Polaris at the center?* What are the dates and times to have Milky Way at certain position on the sky?If you are interested in the answers of any questions above, the PlanIt! is the right app for you. In a simple app, we included Tools feature for you which allow you to find out GPS coordinates, elevation, distance, elevation gain, direct view, focal length, depth of field (DoF), hyperfocal distance and panorama, and all of those are represented to you visually on the map and sometimes in a simulated viewfinder. In addition, the Ephemeris features include the sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset time and location, twilights, special hours of the day, position of the Sun and the Moon, Sun/Moon Finder, more than 100 stars (such as Polaris) azimuth and elevation angle, star trail planning and exposure time calculation, time-lapse and hyperlapse calculation, milky way searching etc. Again, all of them are either represented on the map or in the viewfinder. You can even use existing pictures in the viewfinder to explore with new photographing ideas.And we also promise you that more exciting features are on the way in the next few releases! Just take a look how many features we added from 1.0 to 2.0 and now to 3.0.Please refer to http://yingwentech.wordpress.com/tags/pft for more details.

Artemis works in much the same way as a traditional director's viewfinder but more accurately and with many more features.If you have any issues please email us anytime for support. We are very happy to help!android@chemicalwedding.tvBy selecting your camera, an aspect ratio and a list of lenses, Artemis allows you to compose shots with the same field of view as the camera/lenses you will be shooting with. You can then save images, complete with focal length, GPS data, compass heading, tilt and roll, date and time, camera/lens information, and much more. A great tool for any level of filmmaker, Artemis is perfect for location scouting, storyboarding, blocking, rehearsal and preproduction.For lenses wider than the your devices camera's field of view, Artemis adds \"padding\" on the screen. While this is not ideal, it's our best solution for getting around the limitations of the camera in your device.Artemis has been field tested with every camera in our database to make sure that the field of view is correct. No other multiformat director's viewfinder has as many camera specific formats or lens sets.Please note that field of view is measured from the \"nodal point\", roughly mid way down the length of the lens, in keeping with the method used by lens manufacturers. ***Major update coming soon!

{"title": "HDR Edit Pro", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Wombatix", "rating": "4.3983049392700195", "Description": " With this intuitive photo editor, you can apply HDR style tone mapping to any picture. More specifically, it enables you to adjust overall scene contrast and detail level contrast separately. In practice, you can create beautiful pictures even from relatively bland looking photos. HDR Edit saves your processed pictures in full original resolution.Usage tipsOn the editor screen, you can hide/show the toolbars by dragging the triangle icons. You can also quickly hide all controls by holding you finger down on the screen.There is a list of presets to get you started, but you probably want to customize the settings a little bit for each picture. If you know what you want, the Neutral setting is a good starting point. First experiment with scene contrast and detail contrast sliders until you find a combination that works for you. There is no single \"correct\" setting for any picture. Trust your eye to find settings that bring out the essence of your picture.After you have found contrast settings you like, the rest is fine tuning. Adjust saturation and brightness to your liking. You can also adjust color balance and highlight/shadow definition. When you like what you see, click Save.

I'm in total love. Enough said.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Michael Reiser Replaced my default camera app I am absolutely thrilled! Thanks for the great app!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Dirk NiekampPerfectShot is a camera application that focus on features that help you improve your photos BEFORE they are taken rather than after. By making use of features provided by the latest development of Android API and hardware, PerfectShot helps you eliminate chances of imperfect shots and improve efficiency of the controls so you can take better images and be ready sonner when the precious moment comes.The main features are:\u2605 Smart AF system not only make sure every picture is in focus but also not get in the way when you need fast response to capture a precious moment.\u2605 Gyroscope supported vibration detection mode eliminates the possibilities of blurry hand shake photos.\u2605 Video recording with instant parameter update. This means you can manipulate all parameters of the camera while the video recording is in progress! Zoom, exposure compensation, white balance, color effects are all changeable while recording video.\u2605 Allow you to select AF & AE metering area, separately! We are certain all shutterbugs know the significance of \"separately\" here, it means you can focus on one thing but measure exposure on another, thus gives you great flexibility on how you present the subject in your photo. Traditionally this is done through AE lock on DSLRs, but please come and experience what this should be done on a smart phone!Please note that this is not supported by all devices. Most modern high-end devices we tested are working fine (eg. Nexus series, HTC, LG...) but Samsung Galaxy series and a few models from other manufacturers do not support setting AE metering area, therefore cannot use this feature.\u2605 AF & AE area selections are assisted by AR technology that can lock the area selection on the screen with the object it is attached to. Normally after you move the camera to adjust the composition, you need to select focus and metering area again, but with PerfectShot you don't need to, all area selections will stay with the object while you move to recompose.\u2605 Virtual horizon guide lines with pitch angle display. With help of gyroscope, the virtual horizon in PerfectShot is fast & accurate. Its smoothness is 1000 times better than the ones that use accelerometer done on other apps.\u2605 Extreme optimisation on the code brings tiny APK size as well as tiny memory footprint. This allow PerfectShot to launch fast. Some users even report it launches faster than the system camera app.\u2605 Custom UI allow you to complete most operations in a single touch. It allow you to change camera parameters swiftly and accurately.\u2605 Compatible with system camera intent. You can use PerfectShot to take pictures for other app, and on ICS system you can launch PerfectShot from lock screen.

{"title": "Photo Tools Full", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Artem+Yankovskiy", "rating": "4.80555534362793", "Description": " Photo Tools is the Android application, which has the simple interface. It will be helpful for the beginner photographers using the DSLR-cameras.The app includes three tools:1.The calculator of the depth of field (further \u2013 the DoF-calculator).2.The calculator of the exposure pairs.3.The calculator of the sunsets time and the sunrises time.Difference from free version:1. You can restrict the range of values in DoF2. You can restrict the range of values in Ev-Pairs3. You can search location on the map by address or coordinates.The DoF-calculator will be helpful at the landscape shooting that needs the maximum depth of field. If you\u2019ll choose the model of your camera and will set the aperture\u2019s value, the focal distance and the distance of the focusing action, you\u2019ll find distant both near limit of the sharpness and the hyperfocal distance. You\u2019ll get the maximum depth of field in shot by focusing at this hyperfocal distance.The calculator of the exposure pairs is being the special value at the shooting at night time when the built-in exposure meter is lacking for the calculation of the correct time of the exposition (built-in exposure meters can calculate exposure up to 30 seconds only).Simple example: you wish to shoot the night landscape. The built-in exposure meter shows, that the exposure will be equal to 30 seconds at ISO = 1600 and the aperture = 5.6. But your camera has digital noise at ISO = 1600. If you\u2019ll reduce the sensitivity to ISO = 400, exposure time will be 2 minutes and you\u2019ll cover the aperture to 11, the exposure will increase up to 8 minutes. Photo Tools is created for the calculation of these parameters.

Header of photo contains GPS coordinates, street address (street name can be turned off for photos taken in open fields), time/date stamp. Time/Date stamp uses NTP (national time protocol) in UTC format. If NTP servers are unreachable, the device's time/date will be used in the header and will be signified using an asterisk * next to the time. 2. Footer of photos contains option for (a) add left-aligned text from a drop-down menu with the prefixes of #, File #, Case #, Report #, Project #, Subject, Victim, Suspect, and Witness; and (b) users to insert their own right-aligned identifying alphanumeric text. 3. GPS location can be refined only by up to 100 yards. If the user changes the location by more than 100 yards these changes are discarded. 4. Notes section allows user to input notes regarding photos for later reference. ***About UTC*** As more sophisticated time pieces became available to scientists, the need for a new international time standard became apparent. It became understood that due to the irregularity of the earth and the sun's movements, the exact time needed to be modified occasionally through the use of leap seconds. With the need for precise accuracy of time, UTC was born. While based on zero degrees longitude, which passes through the Greenwich Observatory, is based on atomic time and includes leap seconds as they are added to the clock every so often. UTC was used beginning in the mid-twentieth century but became the official standard of world time on January 1, 1972. UTC is 24-hour time, which begins at 0:00 at midnight. 12:00 is noon, 13:00 is 1 p.m., 14:00 is 2 p.m. and so on until 23:59, which is 11:59 p.m.Because UTC time is indicated on the photo, users need to add/subtract their time zone differences to determine the image's local time. Users can find their time zone difference here: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/difference.htmlObviously, it would not be fair to have the timestamp permanently maintain a specific time zone (for example, EST) - others users in different time zones would not take kindly to this. UTC is the only time zone universally accepted around the World.

Triggering of shots or start of Timer or HDR sequences by the ambient light sensor on your smartphone (keyword: light barrier)9. Triggering of shots or start of Timer or HDR sequences by the internal or an external microphoneIn various models Canon seems to limit the precision of the bulb mode to one second. So HDR exposures below 1 second and/or with a fraction of a second (as 1.5 sec) are rounded to the full second. DSLR Remote Plus can't do anything about that! Reported models so far: 400D, 500D, 550D, 5D II.Using a built-in IR sender:DSLR Remote should work with the built-in IR sender of the followig devices (don't forget to choose the right camera brand and to switch your camera into remote mode):Samsung- All Samsung devices with built-in IR senderThere seems to be a bug in some/all Samsung devices: in power saving mode the IR blaster doesn't work correctly! So, make sure to switch your device into normal (non-power saving) mode before using DSLR Remote.HTC- All HTC devices with built-in IR senderLG (Beta)- G3For the time being only the LG G3 is supported by the LG QRemote API including sending raw IR data (see: http://developer.lge.com/MOBILE_HELP/topic/lge.mobilesdk.LGQRemote.api/html/Introduction/Introduction/Supported%20Devices.htm ).SonyUnfortunately, doesn't the Sony native IR API provide the feature needed by any remote app like DSLR Remote, as is deploying its own IR codes as data with the app. The only thing possible in the API is using codes learned from physical remotes or codes supplied with the phone/tablet. If your device doesn't run Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat) or Kitkat can not support the built-in IR hardware of your device for the above mentioned reason, please use a IR dongle or cable release hardware as described on the DSLR Remote website.Other BrandsWith integration of the Android 4.4.2 (Kitkat) IR API DSLR Remote should work with all devices with a built-in IR Blaster supported by the Kitkat IR API.Using DSLR Remote hardware:Caution: a few smartphone types do not output high enough volume on their ear phone jack to make the infrared harware work properly. In addition a few camera types (e.g. Canon EOS 550D) are still not properly controlled remotely via the infrared receiver. In that case you might want to choose the cable control (transistors) instead.Supported camera brands when using as an infrared remote:Canon, Fuji, Minolta, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and SonyIf it doesn't work for you, feel free to contact the author, instead of voting one star.

SLR has many options and can seem a bit\"what the heck?\" :)If your light colours are wrong on selection see the above guide for selecting the swap RGB button.Studio Light Rigger (SLR) allows you to plan in 3D your favourite lighting set-ups, those set-ups can be Loaded/Saved to a library on the device. You can add a text description to every object so you can make notes of the real world settings of your shoot, this is how SLR started as a fancy 3D drawing pad. SLR gives you a real-time view of the lights you place down with number of models to light with full colour and shadow maps. The models include a female with 30 odd poses, a hi resolution male with poses and various models such as an over sized head for seeing the affects of shadows. SLR video and guide over at www.misort.com under the Apps tab. Main features. Moving objects in a 3D plan and perspective views. A real time camera lens view with real time shadows (GLES2 required) Female and Male with multiple poses character models to light. Store your lighting rigs using the Built in library or upload to mIsort for sharing General issues.Touch screens, some devices when under load are sending the App movements when a touch has been made which results in the object being selected moving on touch a little. While I see if something can be done about this  (it's quite device specific) each object does have the lock option that locks movement of that object until unlocked.The Background can be removed.Rendering Performance.The Lens View and shadow maps size can be adjusted for better shadow maps and render speed. Small screen devices can get away with the Lens View window on two and shadow maps on three.**Please Note** On most devices maximum settings will slow the device down to a crawl and leave the APP unresponsive.Increasing the shadow map to maximum offers better shadows and does not slow down the device as much.   Rendering Improvements.A number of objects can use pixel shaders with normal mapping and specular hi-lights. Thisgives a more  realistic for the Male/Female heads and vehicle.The shadows can now be filtered for more realistic and softer shadows. The filter size can also beadjusted.**Please Note** Filtered shadows are not free and do slow the device down a fair bit.Overall rendering speed is up for example.The Male character that was slow in SLR 1.2.3 can now be worked on now with a defy usinga Lens View Size of two and Shadow Map of size three - with three Shadow Mapped Lights withshadow filters turned on at good frame rates.The best approach is to do your editing in the lowest settings that gives useful feedback the up the settings for a cleaner render.Some new objects, a vehicle and female head.

Currently not working on Android 4.4.DeblurIt is a professional way to sharpen blurry photos. It provides unrivaled clarity and successfully removes motion blur, out-of-focus blur, gaussian blur from your images. Fix photo blur and sharpen non-blurred images with DeblurIt!It uses progressive algorithms based on deconvolution technology. While commonly used \"unsharp mask\" filter just detects the edges and adds them to the original image, deconvolution uses information within the image to approximately restore the original state and fix photo blur. Deconvolution perfectly restores photos with large defects, recovering lost details. DeblurIt is the only app that supports deconvolution on Android (28.02.2013)You can also use unsharp mask filter that removes blur in more standard way. It is the best fit for small defects.Auto mode uses unsharp mask to quickly deblur the photo.Key features:* Use auto mode to quickly increase sharpness and deblur your photos.* Two completly different approaches (deconvolution filter, sharpen filter) to restore blurry photo covers both large and small defects.* Compare original image with restored one using preview button* Capture photos using your camera without leaving program* Supports images up to 4096x4096 (depends on your device RAM)* Fast image processing* Works in background, notifies user when the process is done* custom settings and save path for both filters* Export to PNG and JPEG* No ads in pro version* Feedback* Processing in grayscaleFAQ:Q: I am getting \"File not found\" error. What should I do?A: Try another file manager.Q: Application is terminating with \"Out of memory\" error while deblurring image.A: Try cleaning up RAM.

{"title": "KMLZ to Earth Pro", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=WrightRocket", "rating": "4.263157844543457", "Description": " KMLZ to Earth Pro allows you to view KML and KMZ files on your Android device using Google Earth without advertising! If you are unable to view a KML or KMZ file or attachment in Google Earth, then this may be the app that you need! KMLZ to Earth Pro allows you to browse through your local files to select a KML or KMZ file to display in Google Earth. It also allows you to view your saved email attachments in Google Earth.In the Explorer activity, if you browse to a directory containing images with location information you can also:* Tap the file icon to view the photo closely* Tap the file name to create a KMZ file * Tap \"View images to create KMZ\" to create a KMZ file with the locations and images from multiple photosIn your email application, save the KML or KMZ file, and then tap it again to choose to view it with KMLZ to Earth Pro.Since Google Earth for Android doesn't seem to have published limits on file sizes, your success with files larger than 4MB may vary. Large files cause Google Earth to to load slowly, or if they are too large, not display them entirely. If this occurs, try to reduce the size of the images used or the number of images selected to create smaller KMZ files.\u00a0The size of the images shown in Google Earth decreases progressively as the total size of images are selected, in order to try to keep the total file size small enough to view on Google Earth for Android.When creating a KMZ file, each image containing location information is shown as a thumbnail, along with the image name, time taken, resolution and size. Thumbnails can be tapped for a larger preview of the image. All, none, or individual files can be selected to create a KMZ file from images in one directory. DO NOT PUT SPACES OR OTHER STRANGE CHARACTERS IN FILE NAMES! LETTER, NUMBER, UNDERSCORE, PERIOD, AND HYPHEN CHARACTERS ALLOWED. ANY OTHER CHARACTERS WILL BE REPLACED WITH UNDERSCORES.File names must end in \".jpg\", \".kml\", \".kmz\" to be visible to view in KMLZ to Earth Pro, and capitalization does not matter. Files that you select to view are copied to the \"Home\" directory, typically /mnt/sdcard/kmlz. WARNING! Any file that does not end in \".kml\" or \".kmz\" will be deleted automatically from this directory, or when you choose to use Menu, Clear Home, and confirm.The Home button will take you quickly to the /mnt/sdcard/kmlz directory (or a similar path) to see which files you have previously viewed, and view them again.This app can't be set as default for any action, if you try, then it will reset itself. This ensures you the choice of action always and prevents a possible undesirable loop.If experiencing problems with Google Earth, use the Menu, Manage Earth, and either Force Stop, Clear Data, or Clear Cache. Clear Cache is very helpful to get accurate results if you are testing the same file name multiple times.Likewise, if experiencing problems with KMLZ to Earth, use the Menu, Manage KMLZ, and either Force Stop, Clear Data, or Clear Cache.This application runs a web server on your device at http://localhost:8001/ to serve pages from it's \"Home\" directory to Google Earth. In order to do this, it will have a running process in the background. A notification will be issued to remind you that this process is running. If you view the notification, then you can stop this background web server process.  Also, from the application, pressing back will allow you to terminate the application and the background web server process.

Join internationally-acclaimed author and MPV trainer Iain Anderson from exotic Brisbane, Australia, as he cheerfully and expertly guides you through the basics of what you need to know to get working with Adobe Illustrator CS6. Iain kicks off this Illustrator tutorial by showing you how to work with basic Lines and Shapes, but quickly delves deeper by demonstrating the advanced attributes of Strokes, Fills and Gradients. In a very short time, you will have a thorough understanding of the intrinsic power of these components. Iain then moves on to show you the power of the Pen tool. Along the way, he also shares many of his special Pen tricks on how to best modify B\u00e9zier Paths. While creating drawing objects is important, anyone who has used a traditional eraser shield knows how important precise erasing techniques can be. Iain shows you his favorite Illustrator tricks and shows you the tools you need for accurate erasing and deleting. With these methods, you will be able to partially or completely erase and edit drawing objects with ease and confidence. When it comes time to organizing your graphic art work, Iain\u2019s expert advice on good Grouping and Layering practices in Illustrator will make your life a lot easier and get you working faster. He goes in-depth in this area and will make you an expert organizer in no time. Next, Iain shows you how to Transform objects. He demonstrates a variety of techniques that use both the basic tools as well as the more advanced and powerful commands and functions available in Illustrator CS6. Since Text is such a critical part of creating most illustrations, Ian then discusses and demonstrates the uses of point text, paragraph text as well as how to place text along a curving path. In this section, you'll also find out how easy and fast it is to convert text items to Outlines so you can apply all the techniques you have learned to these new graphical objects. To cap the tutorial off nicely, Iain puts it all together in a \u201cmini-project\u201d that shows you how to apply everything you\u2019ve learned up to this point by producing a simple but professional logo design.

You simply compose, shoot a short video clip (3 or 5s), circle the area(s) to animate, press Ok and you are ready to share your creations with the world.  It is that easy! For those who like to keep your creations, fotodanz+ saves your images using animated PNG format for smother higher quality color renditions.  It automatically converts your images to GIFs when sharing so the images can be viewed easily and the file sizes are smaller for sharing.  Note that GIF format can only handle 256 colors so the quality of the files shared are limited by this format.  Your fotodanzes are saved locally under pictures\\fotodanz folder in png format.  You can access them and share them anyway you like.  We have made it easy to share via Facebook, Twitter and SMS. We have enabled Generic Sharing too.  For more privacy, you can share directly via emails.  Enjoy! ----------------FOTODANZ REVIEWS:CNET Editors' Rating: Excellent 8.1/10 - \"fotodanz's simplicity is certainly its biggest strength. That said, it is a fantastic app for creating cinemagraphs.\" - Jaymar Cabebe, reviews.cnet.com (http://cnet.co/Su1aOe)\"fotodanz is truly an interesting new addition to the long list of photography apps in the Play Store.  Not only is it super easy, it also makes great looking photos that truly dance.\", Kim Barloso, android.appstorm.net (http://bitly.com/VzHleU)\"It\u2019s one thing to say that a photo is alive; it\u2019s another thing to build a tool to actually make it so. fotodanz is similar to Flixel [and other cinemagraph applications like Cinemagram and Kinotopic on iPhone] but manages to keep things simple.\u201d, Daniel Bader, www.MobileSyrup.com (http://bit.ly/LDzvWg)\"Dancing photos are now finally at your discretion, with the exclusive launch of fotodanz over on Google Play. \u2026the new Android app is very easy to use and\u2026 \u2026will provide you with all you need to come up with your own cool cinemagraphs.\u201d, Adrian Diaconescu, www.androidauthority.com (http://bit.ly/N5FLNL.)\"[fotodanzes] remind me of the pictures we could see in the entire 'Harry Potter' series, pictures that moved; this  feels the same, just that the movements are reduced to a couple of seconds.\", Aitor Ruiz, www.andronly.com article  in Spanish: http://bit.ly/OCadcs | Google Translation in English: http://bit.ly/LVkZR4----------------How it Works:1.

{"title": "InstaCamera Pro", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=We+Make+Websites+NZ", "rating": "4", "Description": " InstaCamera is the quickest way to take a photo with your phone.   There's no long process: just press the widget and it takes a photo, then closes just as quickly.  .  ## Why should I pay for this when there's a free version?  * This one's quicker. Like, seriously 'turbo computer-brains Skynet' quicker* There are no ads* You can choose the folder your images get saved in* Because you want to say \"awesome!\" with money  .  ## Why is it so awesome?  InstaCamera is perfect for when you want to take a photo but there's tons of pesky seals and squirrels and dogs around who you KNOW are gonna pop up in front to spoil the shot. And then they're all, 'oh, I was smelling something' but really they're jealous of your Android phone and opposable thumbs and want to ruin your whole day with their stupid faces. But you've got a super-fast camera app, so you've snapped a photo before they've even decided which face to pull. Take that, nature!  .  ## Settings  Even though the app is super-simple, you can change how it works. Open the settings (the wrench icon on the widget) and you can make these adjustments:  * choose the folder your photos get saved in* take multiple shots in a row (up to five)* mute the shutter sound* turn the \"Image Saved\" confirmation off* change the photo resolution (default is max)  * set the focus mode (including fixed, infinite, auto and macro focus modes)* set the shutter delay (from not-even-focusing to two seconds) in case your camera hardware needs extra time  * stay in camera mode after taking instant photos (then you touch the screen to take more, and back button to quit)There are two widgets: the 1x1, which is just the camera button, and the 2x1, which has a camera button and a settings button.  .  ## Permissions  We got it down to three permissions in this version:  Storage: the app needs to save photos on your phone.   Hardware controls: the app needs to access the camera.  Wakelock: the app needs enough time to save your photo if you turn the screen off before it's 100% done. (Not the scary, battery-draining kind of wakelock. The cool kind that's chilled out.)Note: there's also a Google thing called Check License which doesn't show up in the permission screen, but it's in the app. It pings the Market every once in a while and says the app is legit.   .  ## Feedback  If you like it or don't like it, say why in your review comment. That way we can make it better instead of just being sad and grumpy and trying one more time to get all the stars on Angry Birds but why doesn't it shoot in the right place, the stupid thing!?!? We made this app because it's slightly more awesome than what's out there already, so if you can use your words then it'll be better next time, we promise.

{"title": "GoPro SD Backup2Phone 480p", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Flat+Possum", "rating": "5", "Description": " GoPro SD Backup2Phone 480p * Important note: If you have the free version installed, uninstall it before downloading this version!Failing to do so will prevent the One Tap Preset feature from working.If that already happened, long-tap the One Tap Preset button then restart the app to fix the problem.Quickly backup your GoPro Hero SD card to your phone with 2 taps.This app replaces the obsolete GoPro SD Backup2Phone.Completely rewritten and optimized, with better performance, new interface and more flexible.This app provides a quick and easy way to back up your GoPro Hero3 (or other model) memory card to your Android device. It's designed specifically with the GoPro Hero3 in mind, but will work with any Hero card you can mount on your Android device. You will need an OTG USB cable and a card reader (or Micro USB card reader) to mount your GoPro's SD card on your phone. OTG USB cables can be found in eBay for less than $5.GoPro SD cards are automatically detected, and only the media files will be copied to your device. * Important notice about card detection:   If your GoPro SD card is not automatically detected by the app, chances are your phone's ROM is mounting USB external devices in some subdirectory of the internal memory, rather than in the standard Android mnt directory. If you are experiencing this problem, please email me.This app was optimized for a 480p screen resolution(such as found on the Samsung Galaxy S2), but should work with any Android device that supports USB OTG and have a similar display resolution.Devices with different screens may not display the app's menus properly but should still work, as long as OTG is supported.Prerequisites: * Your phone must support USB OTG (USB on the go).  * You must have a USB OTG cable and a USB card reader, or a micro USB card reader.  * You will have to know your phone's storage mount name (emmc, sdcard, ext_sd etc) to set up the backup storage location. Features: * Backup all media files from your GoPro Hero3 or other Hero models SD into your phone's storage memory with two taps.  * Backup files of one type only (photos, videos, video thumbnails or Low Resolution Videos), or any combination of types.* One Tap Preset: Backup using your preferred settings (file types to copy and where to save them) with a single tap. * Selectable destination storage (internal phone storage or expansion card).  * Destination folder is automatically named by date and time, and placed in \"gopro backups\" parent folder. * Progress barLimitations/known issues: * USB OTG data rate is slow. Live with it. It may take 10 minutes to copy 1GB. * Not all OTG cables and card readers created equal! Some will be slow to copy, drain battery in minutes, dismount the SD card, cause random reboots, or any combination of the above. Avoid using fancy readers with LEDs and hubs, they are power hungry and will cause you grief.Test yours and change the OTG/card reader or both if you are having issues. To conserve battery, remove your OTG when copy is finished. * If your backup storage is full, the app may hang, or may report a successful copy, but the destination folder will have partial or no data. Free some space then try again. * Large capacity memory cards consume more power. If your device behave nicely with smaller capacity cards but become unstable with the big ones, avoid using them.  * Data stored on the SD card, outside of the ###GOPRO folder will NOT be copied.* Touching the BACK button will make the graphic interface disappear, but the app will not terminate. If a backup was in progress when this happened, it will complete successfully without any visual progress indication, then a copy-finished notification will show.* If the GoPro SD card is removed while copying is taking place, the app may hang or report a successful copy.Make sure your OTG cable and card reader are securely connected to avoid accidental dismounting of the card reader.

Once you start the app, the scene in front of you becomes miniaturized on the screen with real time preview.Miniaturized photo is created by image effect called tilt shift effect but, not only that, the scene itself is important as well.  For example, taking distant view from high position results in beautiful miniaturized image. On the other hand, if you simply take photo of some objects from up close, tilt shift effect does not cause miniaturized effect so much. So, this app offers real time preview of tilt shift effect so that you can find the best location for miniaturized effect.With this app, you don't need to do difficult image correction for tilt shift effect. Let's take as many miniaturized photo as you want and share the favorite one on twitter or facebook![Tips]- Taking photo from high position gives you good miniaturized effect. This is because when you look at toy, your eye position is far above the toy. This generates good illusion - If you would like to take photo for single object like food, it is better to have a distance from that object. If the object occupies whole camera image, miniaturized effect does not work.[Features]- Real time miniaturized preview.- Focused area selection.   - Select focused area with double touch (pinch in/out).  - Move the area with single touch (drag&drop).- Focus strength adjustment. (Bottom slider bar)- Camera zoom. (Upper slider bar)- Share captured photo to twitter, facebook or others.- Edit functionality. (Adding miniaturized effect to existing photo).- Camera flash.[Difference between Lite version and Pro version]- Pro does not have advertisements.- Pro supports edit functionality (adding the effect to existing photo and save the result).* This app is not good at taking photo in the dark.

Don't want to light yourself up while using your phone in the movies or any other dark place?  Glare Gone is for you!  Have you ever been out in the sun and you want to take a picture but you can't see your screen?  Now you can just  tilt your phone to light your screen to 100% brightness level! IMPORTANT: Be sure to shut off your auto-brightness under display in your settings and take your brightness level down to about 20%.  If you ever feel like tilting the phone is not making the screen brighter, check your brightness setting.  I have noticed that it can creep up over time.By touching the Done button instead of backing out Glare Gone knows to keep running in the background.Read Anywhere in Any Color for up to 2 hours.  Thousands of colors!1)  Change your color by tapping the color bars2)  Tap the color level to change the brightness of the color3)  Set your time using the clock in the upper right corner of the color screen4)  MUST hit the DONE button to activate color screenThis app is the fastest way to change your brightness and screen color settings. Its main purpose is to run in the background and light your screen with the tilt of the phone so you can see the screen better in the sunlight.  It is only limited by your phone's hardware.  After all, if you can't see your screen, how are you going to find settings to set your brightness to 100%? Just set the time on the automatic screen and forget about it.  When you need it, unlock your screen, tilt the phone and you are now on your brightest display setting.  It's not perfect, but it will add just enough light to see what you are looking at. I hope you enjoy the simplicity of this app.Just tilt It for more light!Have FunTell a friendFrom an enthusiastic beta tester\u201cI LOVE this app! I tested it on am HTC One X.  I really love the auto/off toggle switch, so easy to use.

However, there are are number of established composition guidelines which can be applied in almost any situation, to enhance the impact of a scene.Leonard Fibonacci discovered that if you have a sequence of numbers beginning with 1,1, where the next number in line is the sum of the previous two, then the sequence will progress towards a more and more exact representation of the golden ratio. The fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc.Oddly enough nature tends to organize growth and limbs according to this sequence. For example the ratio between the length of limbs of your fingers is the golden ratio. The ratio between the length of your nose and the distance from the bottom of the chin to the bottom of the nose is the golden ratio. The spiral growth of crustaceans follows the golden spiral. The divine proportions are an in-built (or in-grained) aesthetic parameter we judge beauty by.This camera focuses on composition and not on playing around with settings like ISO, White balance, Exposure, Saturation, etc... settings like this should be done automatically so that all you need to do is to compose and take the shot.\u2605What makes a camera great is the person behind it.\u2605This is the paid free version. No ads and does not access internet which improves battery and performance.Composition Guides:-Virtual Horizon-Golden Sections-Golden Triangles-Golden spiral-Golden spiral (stretched)-Symmetric Face Geometry-Rule of thirdsOther Features:-Self Timer-Time Lapse (Intervalometer)-Sound level shutter trigger-Light level shutter trigger-Angle shutter trigger-Off screen shooting (Candid mode)-Vibration feedback (for Candid mode)-Volume button shutter-Silent shutter (Some devices have a locked shutter sound and cannot be turned off)-Fast start up-Full image resolution (standard 4:3 to maximize megapixel)-Jpeg compression control-Sensor sensitivity control-User definable image output directory-Geo-tag-(New) Use the headset's previous and forward media button as focus and shutter release.-(New Feature) Now supports a Bluetooth Remote app (Remote for SensorCamera).PRO EXCLUSIVE FEATURE-Manual ISO control-Manual Exposure control-More features soon.To view photography tips go to the Facebook page on Options menu.More features coming soon...Notes: I'm trying to support most phones and tablets but I cannot guarantee full functionality.
