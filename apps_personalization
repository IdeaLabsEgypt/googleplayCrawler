Regardless of your religion, your religious nature implores you to love God and your fellow man. Christians believe in only one God, however, this entity exists in three forms - holy trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ is thought to have been conceived by the Holy Spirit, and given birth by the Virgin Mary. All his endeavors and his miracles were recorded in the \u201cHoly Bible\u201d, the Holy Book of Christianity, consisting of the Old Testament, and the New Testament. The greatest miracle of all is the resurrection of Christ after being crucified on a cross. Thus, the two holidays that hold the greatest importance to Christians are Christmas, celebrating the birth of Christ, and Easter, celebrating the resurrection of  Christ.

Oceans cover more than two thirds of the earth's surface, and they are very deep. They are also filled with lots of plants, which provide food, homes, and protection for animals. They breathe oxygen from the water through gills on the sides of their bodies. They cannot breathe air or live outside of water. Most of them are covered with small scales instead of skin. They use fins and a tail to swim around. Some of their characteristic features are big eyes, translucent body and large, dagger-like teeth. Usually, they are bioluminescent and produces light on their own. Enjoy watching them on your new 'Ocean Fish Live Wall paper'!Whales and dolphins, among other are sea creatures and mammals.  These animals have lungs, are warm-blooded, give birth to live babies (they don't lay eggs) and nurse their babies, but they live in salt water instead of on dry land like most mammals. Sharks look a lot like marine mammals, but they are not and they do not have bones. Their skeletons are made up of cartilage instead of bones. Cuttlefish are unique creatures that have the amazing ability to instantly change the colors and patterns of their skin to blend in with their surroundings.

Falling in love can induce a calming effect on the body and mind and raises levels of nerve growth factor for about a year, which helps to restore the nervous system and improves the lover\u2019s memory. It can also exert the same stress on your body as deep fear. You see the same physiological responses - pupil dilation, sweaty palms, and increased heart rate. A study suggests the psychological hurt of a break up is just as real as a physical injury. Two areas of the brain that respond to physical pain also become activated when a person is dealing with social or \u201cromantic pain\u201d, such as being dumped. Brain scans show that people who view photos of their beloved experience an activation of the caudate - the part of the brain involving cravings.The heart is a common symbol of affection. Ancient alchemists used the symbol of the heart for incantations of love. The heart can represent an inverted triangle in which emotions are poured or carried. In Buddhism, the triangle is an invocation of energy associated with the divine. It can also represent the wings of a dove, which was sacrificed in ancient Israel and which also served as a symbol of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess.Try About Love Live Wallpaper and let your emotions overwhelm both you and your phone \u2013 let it rain down love!

A core concept to Confucianism is Ren , which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself. In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.The concept of Ai was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of \"universal love\". In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in Chinese Buddhism, the term Ai was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, Ai was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.In Turkish, the word \"love\" comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can \"love\" just one special person, which they call the word \"ask.\"Many different theories attempt to explain the nature and function of love. Explaining love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved would be very difficult because to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love are: psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; evolutionary theories which hold that love is part of the process of natural selection; spiritual theories which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; and theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.*Android\u2122 is a trademark of Google Inc.*This app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Samsung.

Peace :)Some curiosity about waterfalls: Waterfalls are commonly formed when a river is young. At these times the channel is often narrow and deep. When the river courses over resistant bedrock, erosion happens slowly, while downstream the erosion occurs more rapidly. As the watercourse increases its velocity at the edge of the waterfall, it plucks material from the riverbed. Whirlpools created in the turbulence as well as sand and stones carried by the watercourse increase the erosion capacity.This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it will carve deeper into the ridge above it. The rate of retreat for a waterfall can be as high as one and half meters per year.Tag: Free live wallpaper, free nature relax, relaxing water cascade , waterfall free wallpaper , beautiful waterfall magic wallpaper  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.water.waterfallbeautylwallpaper", "price": "0", "date_published": "July 28, 2014", "email": "1edensoft1@gmail.com", "downloads": "50,000 - 100,000", "category": "Personalization", "developer": "EdenSoft", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "3.0 and up", "reviewers": "746"}

The flavors of the blooms are green apples and strawberries. Their family also includes pears, apples, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, and almonds. Mythology says that they grew thorns when Cupid accidentally shot an arrow into a garden full of them.The father of Botany Theophrastus (371-286 BC) first classified and identified plants. In his classic books Enquiry into plants and De Causis Plantarum (The causes of plants) he wrote about a hundred-petaled rose and called it centifolia (literally: hundred petals). Roman Emperor Nero liked to shower his guests with fresh petals of this magnificent flower. According to the legend, the dense petal cloud nearly suffocated some of the guests. In the middle Ages, it was customary for the wealthy to put petals and oil of these flowers in their baths. Many noblewomen carried bouquets of fragrant plants to cover body odors.There is a legend that says that during the Roman empire, there was an incredibly beautiful maiden named Rhodanthe. Her beauty drew many zealous suitors who pursued her relentlessly. Exhausted by their pursuit, Rhodanthe was forced to take refuge from her suitors in the temple of her friend Diana. Unfortunately, Diana became jealous. And when the suitors broke down her temple gates to get near their beloved Rhodanthe she also became angry, turning Rhodanthe into a rose and her suitors into thorns.Download Roses Live Wallpaper and beautify your phone with adorable images and lovely spinning roses!

It is a perfect app for all those people who are not morning persons \u2013 the allurement of the sunny wallpaper will enchant and inspire them to get out of the bed and start being productive instead!Sunrise is the instant at which the upper edge of the Sun appears above the horizon in the east. It should not be confused with dawn, which is the point at which the sky begins to lighten, some time before the sun itself appears, ending twilight. Because atmospheric refraction causes the sun to be seen while it is still below the horizon, both sunrise and sunset are, from one point of view, optical illusions. The sun also exhibits an optical illusion similar to the moon illusion.The apparent westward revolution of Sun around the earth after rising out of the horizon is due to Earth's eastward rotation, a counter-clockwise revolution when viewed from above the North Pole. This illusion is so convincing that most cultures had mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model. This same effect can be seen with near-polar satellites as well.Sunrise and sunset are calculated from the leading and trailing edges of the Sun, and not the center; this slightly increases the duration of \"day\" relative to \"night\". The equation, however, is based on the center of the sun.Sunrise Live Wallpaper is a wonderful app, which will lighten up your day and put a smile on your face!

Please read Recent changes section if you are upgrading. If you experience any radical problems, or it's very small, please uninstall and reinstall or go to settings-->apps-->mystic halo and clear application settings. Should overwrite fine on most phones, except possibly some 720p phones like Galaxy S3. I am very sorry for any inconvenience, it will be worth it in the long run as I can add many new features.WARNING: Keep old version with Galaxy Nexus, and Droid RAZR or any old phone (e.g. Galaxy S). Their GPU's are too slow for the shader. I will launch dual-versions from tomorrow.==========================================================A cool, honeycomb-inspired abstract live wallpaper. Blue, patterned rings slowly rotate independently and fade in and out. Touch Enabled, OpengGL. Works on Honeycomb! Watch the video for a demo! New in v8: Optimized for new Galaxy S4,  HTC One and Xperia Z !! (1080p phones)New in v8: Fast color changes!Coming soon in v9: Notifications!!!I created this wallpaper because I loved the basic art used and wished it would move. I'm also a bit tired of so many live wallpapers that look very cool, but are too \"busy\" or colorful to make good long-term useable wallpapers. Art is courtesy Ryan Bliss of Digital Blasphemy: http://www.digitalblasphemy.comFeatures (enabled in \"Configure\" or \"Settings\"):* touch-enabled! Swipe up or down to spin the rings faster. Tap quickly to slow down again* Lots of colours: blue, magenta, pink, red, green, \"Tron\", golden, ice, fire, \"magblue\", green and more! More will be added. Note that loading of new textures can take a few seconds. This is not a bug and will only happen once.* Custom color slider with hue/saturation!* multiple fade schemes: linear, heartbeat, pulse and none. Timings and brightness are settable* sync schemes: make the rings spin in sync, alternating pattern, or random pattern. Control speed in sync and alt modes.* special effects: \"centre glows\" or does not fade out* change minimum fade value for linear fade style* move the centre of the circles left/right or up and down* shrink or expand rings * change brightnessHas been tested on a variety of platforms. Works very well on WVGA phones (especially Galaxy S and Galaxy S 2). Scales correctly for Honeycomb (tested on Galaxy Tab 10.1).Performance heavily optimised using OpenGL and good memory handling. Won't slow your phone down at all. Uses almost no battery life (check battery usage stats... less than your SMS app if registering at all)Special thanks to \"Deep\" Live wallpaper dev and Robert Green for excellent OpenGL framework. I will open source this in time to contribute back. Special thanks also to Roland Harrison, Tim Chen and my other \"beta testers\" for letting me annoy them so much with testing. So many bugs caught!Please support me with a good rating! I will respond to all direct emails.

Apologies to the two of you that reported crashes this afternoon!UPDATE: Added new options menu to set speed of background and foreground scanlines, added the following color schemes: Green, Amber, Blue, and Red. You are able to enable/disable the foreground scanline, and enable/disable animation of the background scanlines. Added the often requested RobCo frames, which include an editable message (Defaults to \"RobCo PipBoy 3000\", can be disabled by simply setting the custom text to nothing in settings.) and an optional clock that shows the current time on the right side of the frame. The frame's top and left padding can be adjusted so you can move the frames below any widgets (On ICS and above there is a permanent Google widget at the top of the screen, this can be avoided by setting your top padding.), and change how far away from the edges of the screen the frames should be. You can also change the width of the scanlines in the background. Lower widths look great on high resolution displays. For most medium to high resolution phones I recommend a setting of 3px, but feel free to experiment!COMING SOON: I'll be adding the option to enable RobCo labels around the edges of the wallpaper, as some of you have requested. I apologize for the huge delay in updates, but I'm back to regular Android development and am excited to give you guys the features you've been asking for, as well as some new apps and wallpapers.

Excellent for meditation, relaxation, and visual dreaming at any time.It comes with 200 download credits built-in (twice as many as in v1.4), each good for one sheep.  After they run out you can get more credits with an in-app purchase (for half the price).  After downloading the initial flock, you should get a few more each day.The app is specially designed to minimize power consumption.  With normal use it should have no measurable impact on the battery, however when it's first installed and is downloading the initial flock it takes more power.    It has an option to only download when on a WiFi network, in case you have a limited data plan.Once you install and run it, tap the screen to bring up the status overlay, or hit the menu button to see the main commands, including the preferences where you can change the speed (FPS).By default the speed is set to slow so it's not too distracting and doesn't use too much battery. If you want it to go faster, use the preferences.  You can also set it to stop running when your battery gets low.Note: the sheep that you download are saved on your SD card.  You can back them up yourself, and share them among your devices.  But if a device is wiped, the sheep on it are lost.  You can restore the app, and it will come with points that you can download new sheep.

The flag most commonly identified as the Jolly Roger today is the skull and crossbones, a flag consisting of a human skull above two long bones set in an x-mark arrangement on a black field. This design was used by several pirates, including Captains Edward England and John Taylor.Some Jolly Roger flags also include an hourglass, another common symbol representing death in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. Despite its prominence in popular culture, plain black flags were often employed by most pirates in the 17th-18th century. Historically, the flag was flown to frighten pirates' victims into surrendering without a fight, since it conveyed the message that the attackers were outlaws who would not consider themselves bound by the usual rules of engagement\u2014and might, therefore, slaughter those they defeated (since captured pirates were usually hanged, they did not have much to gain by asking quarter if defeated).CREDITS=======Some background scene use in this app are from creative commons.

It's like three-dimensional and stuff!Fully interactive. Bored in your meeting? Ignoring your spouse? Stuck in a snowstorm with no reception? Fling yourself to another world. Swipe and poke your way through the solar system. You've probably done less productive things with your time!Highly customizable. So many settings you'll probably need instructions. You're in luck as those are included! Don't like instructions? You are further in luck as the default settings are pretty great already!Because you're awesome you've decided either to upgrade from the lite version or have come straight to the cow demanding your $1.25 of precious milks.This full version is way better. For instance now you can create totally new random solar systems with random planetary characteristics. One poke in the center of the screen and an entire system is vaporized in an all-consuming supernova before birthing a new system in its wake. Pick up your jaw there is more.Spruce up the bland of black and white starfields with a variety of colorful nebulae. Watch a comet zip by and further demonstrate an unhealthy obsession with lens flare effects.But certainly best of all is the music visualization.

Scenery includes a haunted forest, a grave yard, a haunted pumpkin patch and occasional visits from witches, ghosts, zombies, and the grim reaper himself. Now with lots of new monsters like animated spiders, haunted trees, halloween cats, lurking vultures, scarecrows and a curious ghost in the forest!Once purchased zombies and ghosts are intended to be fairly rare especially compared to witches and bats. You never know when a zombie will pop up from behind a grave or over a hill but you can be sure it wont happen too often. Ghosts are very difficult to spot as they like to try and hide behind trees and buildings. Often you will only catch a glimpse of them as they hurry from one hiding spot to another. The Grim Reaper is the rarest of all! Not only that, but by his nature he blends in very well with the background. When you do see him he will be as still as the grave in an effort to escape your notice.If you are are just dying to see these rare creatures then you can always go into the settings and increase the monster frequency.Halloween Screamscape works great on all screen sizes supporting both landscape and portrait mode for phones and tablets.

Live wallpapers are in a sense always on, meaning that users who have them installed on their SD card, will always have to reselect the wallpaper again from the wallpapers list after the SD card is once again available. This is the reason why we strongly recommend you to keep the Live Wallpaper you are using installed on your devices internal memory.---If you experience any problems with the application, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Early morning, May 2, 2011, hours after President Barack Obama announced Osama bin Laden's death2. September 12, 2009 - Washington D.C. Tea Party members on the West Lawn looking toward the United States Capitol Building.Introduction (from wiki):The Gadsden flag is a historical American flag with a yellow field depicting a rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike. Positioned below the snake is the legendary \"DONT TREAD ON ME\". The flag was designed by and is named after American general and statesman Christopher Gadsden. It was also used by the Continental Marines as an early motto flag. It was the first flag ever carried into battle by the United States Marine Corps, during the American Revolution.We hope that these 3D national flag apps are of use to anyone wanting to learn more about the nations of the world. We truly believe that knowledge of other nations and cultures will help lead to further peace and understanding in the world, and learning about other national flags and anthems is a good beginning.

Battery saving functionality is also included. You will experience tunnels like \"Shaman's tunnel\", \"Alien cells tunnel\", and \"Underground plasma tunnel\".This app can be used to energize and stimulate the mind.

You can then start Morphing tunnels. The app will then sync with the music from your music player. There is no music player with a user interface included in this app.  Please use your favorite music player instead and then start Morphing tunnels.****How to change the music syncing capabilities****You can adjust these music syncing capabilities: Fog density, Speed, Color 1)Fog densityThe amplitude of the music determines how much the fog pulsates. With a high Fog density, the effect of the music visualization is is seen more. With a low Fog density, the effect of the music visualization is seen less. 2)SpeedYou can adjust the speed of the tunnel journey so it harmonizes with the speed of the music.

Swadhisthana - Sacral Chakra (ovaries/prostate), orange.Swadhisthana (Sacral Chakra) is located in the sacrum (hence the name) and is considered to correspond to the testes or the ovaries that produce the various sex hormones involved in the reproductive cycle.

The key issues involving Swadisthana are relationships, violence, addictions, basic emotional needs, and pleasure.Manipura - Solar Plexus Chakra (navel area), yellow.Manipura is considered the centre of dynamism, energy, willpower and achievement (Itcha shakti.), which radiates prana throughout the entire human body. It is associated with the power of fire, and digestion. It is also associated with the sense of sight, and the action of movement. Manipura is \"the center of etheric-psychic intuition: a vague or non-specific, sensual sense of knowing; a vague sense of size, shape, and intent of being.\".Anahata - Heart Chakra (heart area), green.Anahata is related to the thymus, located in the chest.

Clouds and the sun move over the sky that shifts color dynamically according to the time of day. As the night slowly falls the moon appears clearer and clearer until fully visible at midnight. The day starts with a dazzling sunrise around 6 am by the lower left corner and ends with a magnificent sunset in the other corner around 6 pm. You can also adjust sunrise and sunset times according to your own taste.While the free version is beautiful, ad-free and fully functional, many settings are locked. The full version is highly customizable:- select background (rape field, mount fuji or meadow)- select foreground flowers- select flower count- select tree (pink sakura, white cherry tree or magnolia)- set tree size- set ground level- set number of petals- set petal size- set any time of day (colors and light change)- or use dynamic real time mode- set sunrise time- set sunset time- option to use GPS once a day to determine location and automatically calculate sunrise and sunset times, in order to make the sun move similar to the real sun in your location- change wind speed- set star count- set night sky brightness- set night light intensity- set position and size of the moon- set rotation speed of the sun- show/hide the sun- show/hide high clouds- show/hide low clouds- toggle silhouette mode- use true color (24 bit)This live wallpaper is OpenGL based. This means that animations and graphics will flow much smother than if it was using the CPU. It also means that the phone's CPU is not working, giving much less impact on overall phone performance. The wallpaper is only active when visible, so battery consumption is very insignificant.Photo credits (flickr users)Magnolia: Tom BrandtSakura: gardener41Cherry Tree: gardener41Meadow: Nicholas_TDaffodils: Mark RobinsonGrass: Maja DumatRape field: Maja DumatMount Fuji: IvanWalsh.comMoon: Luis ArgerichThanks for the creative commons licenses!

In this space, colors are vivid, visually ever shifting, and always mesmerizing.\"Prismatic Dreams is an abstract animated live wallpaper designed to give you the best, freshly made, HD abstract prism fractal content. The idea for Prismatic Dreams stems from my own passion for abstract art. :)Please search for the \"Prismatic Dreams Free\" to try before you buy!That being said, you can also customize how your abstract fractal art looks on your devices background.Here's what Prismatic Dreams Pro gives in terms of features, and options:Visual Options:- Color Shift Speed : Control how fast your colors/HUE animate. Higher speeds lend itself more to trippy effect, while slower speeds a more calming mesmerizing effect.- Blending Mode : Control how your animation blends with your background. Options are \"luminous\" and \"phantom\" modes.- Animation Speed : Control the speed of your animation, again, faster and trippy, or slower and mesmerizing.- Background selector : Manually select your mesmerizing hd background- Animation selector : Manually select your trippy animationContent Options:- Auto Mode : When checked, this option randomizes your abstract prism fractal live wall paper every 24 hours (at 5 am)- Auto Content Updating Mode : Check for content manually, or check this to enable automatic content update - recomended! Depending on when you purchase this wallpaper, you may have a decent library to download, if you wish to download everything. USE WIFI WITH THIS OPTION!! Or incur the wrath of your data gods(checks every 24 hours, at 5 am)- Delete older Content Limit : Automatically manages your downloaded abstract collection to only contain the latest content. If the slider is set to 10 for instance, only the 10 latest backgrounds, and animations will be kept. If set to 0, nothing will ever be deleted.If your device has limited storage, this is perfect for managing your collection and keeping it small.Additional Features / Notes:- Color shift quickens during swype. (Feature not compatible with galaxy s3, and s4, with some launchers)- \"Check for new content\" button for manual updates- \"Clear\" button for deleting all manually downloaded contentI put a lot of time into the art that goes into this, and if you like it, and want more customization options and other art work, you may like this pro version!

UCCW takes this idea further to let you customise widgets on homescreen. Even without rooting your device or installing a custom ROM or installing a special launcher, you can do some incredible things to shape your phone to be just the way you want it. UCCW, or Ultimate Custom Widget, is a widget that lets you place custom clocks, battery meters, weather info, and just about anything else right on your homescreen. There is a sheer number of skins available on Google Play and shared in various forums, and more skins are being added all the time.Customization is often a difficult process, but not with UCCW. Just install a skin, and tell UCCW to show it or make your own skin. UCCW offers a WYSIWYG (What-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor allowing to customise layout, fonts, images, shapes, etc.Features:Basic info like time and dateCustom textsWeek barAnalog clockBattery level, status, bar and circle objectsLocationWeather info like current weather conditions and forecast with icons.

Issues:Widget not updating 1. UCCW may be killed by task killers.  So exclude UCCW in task killers.2. Could be a launcher app issue; Try a different launcher.Getting force closes 1. Uninstall UCCW and install again.2. Check if Force closes are occuring with a particular skin; discard that skin.3. Send a logcat if force closes continue.Skins do not show 1. Google play skins may not appear for some custom roms or if screen density is changed.App Permissions explained:Your messages - to show unread message countStorage - for saving skinsYour location - to show locationNetwork communication - for weather and adsPhone calls - to show missed calls numberYour social information - for direct dial hotspotYour personal information - to show next calendar eventYour accounts - for Gmail unread mails count  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.vineetsirohi.customwidget", "price": "0", "date_published": "March 4, 2014", "email": "vasudev.android@gmail.com", "downloads": "1,000,000 - 5,000,000", "category": "Personalization", "developer": "VasuDev", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://uccw.vasudevsoftwares.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGTFaY05FMtHb7P4lSgI8oanzZdzQ", "reviewers": "31129"}

Or even easier -Watch the Video- and If English is not your first language, you can watch it on your computer --> turn on Closed Captions (CC) --> select your native language --> then subtitles will translate all instructions for you..--------------------------------\"UCCW\" App Required Before Use--------------------------------You will first need the latest version of **Ultimate Custom Widget (UCCW)** a free app, before you are able to use this skin. If you haven't already you can install it in the Play store from this link: http://goo.gl/TZgw0  Props to VasuDev for creating UCCW and the ability to use other skins.--------------------------------How to use this widget--------------------------------Please follow these steps to add the widget to your homescren:1) Long press homescreen, and select add widget. OR from your app drawers widget tab (varies depending on android version and home launcher).2) Add a new standard UCCW widget (size 4x3 large, so on).3) UCCW widget list will appear, choose \"GS3-ish(large)\" or other.4) Touch the pointing finger when it appears and wait a few seconds.5) Re-size as desired (depending on launcher/setup) and Enjoy!Note: All widgets are optimized for a 4x6 or 5x6 icon grid for your homescreen.--------------------------------How to set custom Hotspots--------------------------------1) Make sure UCCW \"Hotspots Mode\" is turned [Off]2) Tap the widget and it will open in the UCCW widget editor3) You can scroll through options list at the bottom to:   -Set colors for each object   -Set Clock format to 24hr / 12hr   -Set all Hotspots (swipe widget to show color areas if they disappear)4) After you are content with your settings, turn \"Hotsopts Mode\" back [ON] and it will exit to your homesceen.Note: It is handy to set one hotspot to \"Open UCCW editor\" for quick access to settings.--------------------------------Other Important Notes--------------------------------It would be good to familiarize yourself with the UCCW app and all its internal settings. [Menu] -> [Settings] and check to make sure your location is found and correct (or set manually -direction on listed there). If your location is not found the backgrounds will not update to correct weather conditions, or a default image will be shown always. Be sure to also set your weather update interval, select your degrees displayed F/C, as well as the night start & end times (so the background photos change correctly). For more info on UCCW there are tutorials are on YouTube showing how work everything. And even create your own custom widgets!Any trouble let me know,Thanks everyone!

{"title": "Peek", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Francisco+Franco", "rating": "4.119458198547363", "Description": " IMPORTANT NOTES: -This application was successfully  tested on stock Android 4.4 and AOSP based 4.4 ROMs, on multiple Nexus devices (including tablets) and Oppo Find 7a.- Internet permission is used for bug catching.This application is a complete redesign of the known \"Peek\" feature by ParanoidAndroid project, built to work on any 4.4+ ROM. The whole concept lies into allowing users to quickly interact with their notifications, without having to press any button. The new design includes sharper typography, nicer placement of the items, breathtaking new effects and extended functionality (including blacklist). It works on secure locked devices, with the ability to customize what information to show.How peek works:When you receive a notification, and screen is off, peek will start polling your sensors. If some movement is detected on your device (either it was on a table and you lifted it, or it was in your pocket and you got it out), peek will show. Sensors will be polled for 10 seconds (by default, customizable) and then it stops doing so, to save battery. It is not possible to simulate the behavior of devices like the Moto X, without affecting battery, since they have special hardware for the task.Featured on:Android Police: http://goo.gl/0Dtr2PAndroid Authority: http://goo.gl/NL9nOiAndroid Authority 2.0 review:: http://goo.gl/x0Hxk9Droidlife: http://goo.gl/WCo7C0Tested: http://goo.gl/HoVR2QAndroid Headlines:: http://goo.gl/5OSw5DChris Nacca YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/233P2GAnd many more!

I have nothing to do with this person.FEATURES:  \u2022 Browse tons of awesome HD wallpapers  \u2022 3 panels to get exactly what you want to see (Toplist, Random, Search)  \u2022 Change your current background instantaneously  \u2022 Save any wallpaper you like locally on your device to be sure to never loose it  \u2022 Share images with any other application supporting images (Hangout, Google Drive, Photoshop, etc.)  \u2022 Browse in a slideshow view to enjoy the quality of each wallpaper  \u2022 Use various settings to customize the application  \u2022 Specific Boost mode to significantly reduce loading time (check advanced settings and read below)IMPORTANT NOTICEThis app is about images. And of course images are heavier than text. So to use this application comfortably, you'll need a fast internet connection. Of course it will work over EDGE or 3G but it'll be slower and I cannot do anything about it.By the way, if your connection is not fast enough, you may encounter failure from time to time when images load. Once again, it's due to the connection and there is not so much I can do about it. When it happens, just try again.A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPERI really want to make this application correspond to you, so don't hesitate to contact me via email for any feature request or if you meet problems when using it.NOTEWallhaven.cc is a website self-described as a huge wallpapers database. Although loving the content of this site, I have nothing to do with it. It means that this application is completely non-official.Moreover, wallhaven.cc is in alpha version, which means that the content could change at any time, leading to stability issues with the application. Thanks to be indulgent about this.NEWS2014-09-10 - wallbase.cc seems to be down. The last version of the app uses wallhaven.cc instead.Please do not leave negative feedback because of this, there is really nothing I can do about it.PERMISSIONS  \u2022 INTERNET: quite obvious but this is to get images.  \u2022 SET WALLPAPER: once again I think every body got this one.  \u2022 WRITE EXTERNAL STORAGE: to save files and to cache heavy images.  \u2022 ACCESS NETWORK STATE : to check if your internet connection is active when you open the app.  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exystenz.wallbase", "price": "EGP9.15", "date_published": "September 16, 2014", "email": "kalvnthereal@gmail.com", "downloads": "100 - 500", "category": "Personalization", "developer": "Kalvn", "content_rating": "Medium Maturity", "operating_system": "4.0 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/kalvn&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHPSBRwYqfggBKi5etCho2gARp60A", "reviewers": "22"}

Back in 1964, Gene Roddenberry proposed science fiction series that would become Star Trek, it was originally touted as a western with the name \"Wagon Train to the Stars\", but it would soon be known to the world as Star Trek.  Each episode was intended to be a suspenseful adventure story as well as functioning as a morality tale.  Almost all Star Trek stories feature humans and aliens that serve as members of \"starfleet\", which is a space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets.  The original Star Trek followed the adventures of James T. Kirk and his crew aboard the Starship Enterprise.  (an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century).  The main characters always feature altruistic values which must applied to difficult situations such as war and peace, authoritarianism, class warfare, economics and so forth.  Complete works of Star Trek to date include:  Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise as well as the Star Trek film series.

{"title": "Smoke & Glass Icon Pack", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Hooolm", "rating": "4.562937259674072", "Description": " I had an idea about doing an icon set with smoke and glass. It's been a while underway, because (much like my Freehand efforts), these icons take absolutely forever to make, but I personally think it's been worth the effort! The icons are individually crafted to look like the essence of each app floating in smoke-filled glass orbs, complete with photorealistics reflections. My wife thinks they look like those old school glassy marbles with threads of paint in them. I see her point. Whatever they look like, the do look great, and I'm happy to share the result with you all :-)And even though I have only done, like, several *hundred* icons \u2757 \ud83d\ude09  - I'm using masking and shaders to make sure that *all* the icons have a consistent appearance.They're set at a buck eighty under my ususal charity umbrella. You can check my website http://circlesmod.dk for further info on what that means.Supported launchers include Nova, Apex, Action Launcher, Inspire, Aviate, Unicon and ADW and to some extent Smart Launcher. Atom Launcher can use the icons via its own settings panel. Go Ex doesn't work, nor will it ever, because Go interprets icon masks differently and ruins everything. The same goes for Mini Launcher. Next Launcher can use the icons via its Theme Manager. == INSTALL NOTES ==- Install the app and open it.- - Select your launcher to apply the icon pack.- - Swipe left/right to navigate between tabs/pages.- - Select \"Wallpapers\" to check out and apply one of the cool wallpapers.- If one of your apps doesn't theme, you can press-and-hold the icon, select \"Edit\" and select one of my icons manually.== CONTACT / SUPPORT / ETC ==If you have problems or issues that require support, , please email me at support@circlesmod.dkIf you have questions or requests for apps for me to theme, please email me at support@circlesmod.dkIf you have funny insights or anything else (constructive) you'd like to share with me, please email me at support@circlesmod.dk or reach out via Twitter or Google+ (links are in the app)I cannot support/communicate with you through the Play Store - depending on your region or language, I might not even be able to see your comments.

However, please read the FAQ below before sending me any questions!FAQ:- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -SKIN DOES NOT SHOW IN WIDGETSAfter downloading the skin from google play, open it and tap \"install\": http://i.imgur.com/bf5UGnf.jpgWhen that's done, add a UCCW widget and then choose IRON UI skin.If this didn't solve your problem, reinstall UCCW and see if that works.THE WIDGETS LOOKS TOO SMALL / DOESN'T ALIGN WELLYou need to change the grid size of your launcher accordingly to your screen resolution. Try disabling notification and the dock, that might increase the widget size.WEATHER IS SHOWING \"F0MIN\" AND \"F0MAX\"The weather bug is usually caused by disabled GPS access. You can try choosing your \"weather provider\" and \"location\" in UCCW's settings, that should fix it!HOW DO I EDIT HOTSPOTS AGAIN?To edit hotspot again, open the uccw app and in uccw's settings, select \"lock widgets\" to \"OFF\". Tap your widget and edit it as you please, then re-enable it when you're done. HOW TO ENABLE UNREAD EMAIL COUNTER?Open \"UCCW\" and go to \"settings\", tap \"hotspot mode\" and set it to \"off\". Tap the email widget and choose your account/inbox. When done, set hotspot mode to \"on\".I DON'T HAVE THE \"THREE DOT\" BUTTONThe three dot button in the video tutorial is the same as pressing \"menu\" on your hardware button.I DO NOT HAVE QUICKPICQuickpic is just another gallery application which handles your images. It does not matter which gallery application you use when setting up your icon or wallpaper.CAN I USE LAUNCHERS OTHER THAN \"NOVA\"?Yes, you can use launchers like \"ADW launcher\" or \"GO Launcher\", as long as the launcher provides many customize-able features!I DON'T HAVE THE \"TABLET\" OPTION IN NOVA SETTINGSThis option is optional, it's not necessary at all to complete the theme. This is simply just a scrolling effect which - once again - is unnecessary. ICON HAS A BLACK BACKGROUND INSTEAD OF TRANSPARENTThis is because some browsers handles the download differently and adds color to transparent areas.Use another browser or download it on your computer and transfer the icon to your device.LOCATION NAME IS NOT CORRECT.Open the UCCW app and go into \"Settings\". Then go into \"Location\" menu and select it to automatically find your location or set it manually. ======================================Disclaimer:This UCCW skin is NOT affiliated to the franchise \"Iron Man\" nor Marvel/The Walt Disney Company.

{"title": "Droidicon - Icon Pack", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Jon+F+Hancock", "rating": "4.49233865737915", "Description": " With over 1,000 icons in 176 different styles/colors, you can break the monotony of traditional themes and icon packs.  For the price of a latte, you can theme all your Android devices exactly how you want them for the rest of your life.Visit me on Google+ to talk about Droidicon: http://gplus.to/DroidiconIn the early days of LauncherPro, there were only a handful of dock icons included in that beautiful and unique LP style we have come to know and love.  To find more icons in that style, you had to search the web and read through 50 page forum posts.  Then you had to download them to your sd card and apply them from there.  The same was true of dock backgrounds.Then, in June 2010, I brought something new to the LauncherPro icon and dock game.  I built launcherproicons.com where artists could upload their icons and docks, and people could easily find them and download them as well as make requests for new icons.  This still had the problem of downloading to the sd card first, then finding them and applying them.  I fixed that problem by developing the Droidicon app.  This app bypasses all the mess of searching for icons on the web, and groups over 1,000 icons and 400 docks into  one app.  When you go to choose a new custom icon, you simply open Droidicon, and start typing the name of the app you are trying to find. The giant list of icons will be filtered down, and you can quickly choose the icon you need.  You can also search through the docks.I decided to take it one step further and add over 170 different styles of icons.  Each icon is available in each style in a broad range of colors.  You can switch styles at any time, and even build sleek home screens that use multiple icon styles for some really beautiful effects.  With this addition, Droidicon transcended LauncherPro, and became valuable to users of ADW Launcher, GO Launcher and the rest of the home screen replacements.If you are looking for a way to escape completely uniform ADW and LauncherPro icon packs and boring stock home screens to theme your phone exactly how you want it, you absolutely need this app.  It is the ultimate tool for personalization.For a few examples of home screens made with our icons and docks visit http://launcherproicons.com/screenshotsHelp me improve the app by telling me what you would like to see at http://droidicon.uservoice.com/The icons can be used out of the box with the following applications:* ADW and ADW EX* Open Home* GO Launcher EX * LauncherPro and LauncherPro PlusIf you also install Desktop VisualizeR or BetterCut, the icons will work with:* Zeam* HTC SenseUI* Android 2.3 Launcher* Launch-X* Any other launcherThe docks can only be used with launchers that support changing the dock background.Some of the artwork in this app is free to download at http://bit.ly/lpicons.

{"title": "LCARS Go Launcher Ex Theme", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Terence69", "rating": "4.085561275482178", "Description": " Inspired as a fan of Star Trek, I wanted to customise my phone to resemble something similar to a Star Trek LCARS console. Now you can too when using this theme with \"Go Launcher Ex\" (free for download, on Google Play).PLEASE READ! (Especially if you have problems with the theme)There seems to be a problem with some users where the theme does not appear or is not selectable on Go Launcher Ex. Apparently Google Play has a problem with downloads of themes like mine and not due to any fault of the theme. Please email me, with or include your registered Google Play email, if you face this situation after purchase. I will reply to every email I receive, so check your spam folder if you do not receive a reply after a couple of days. ** IMPORTANT NOTE **This theme is only usable for phones with Go Launcher EX installed. Search \u201cGO Launcher EX\u201d on Google Play Shop and install it for free. \"Apex Launcher Pro\" (paid version) and \"Nova Launcher\" users can use this theme (I'm told only wallpaper and icons only) as well. As full compatibility is for Go Launcher Ex, I will still recommend that you use Go Launcher Ex for this theme.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** Customisation tips and suggestions for Go Launcher Ex**The screenshots shown, are based on a 5x5 grid from Go Launcher's menu->preferences->Screen settings->Grid size. Up to 14 wallpapers optimised for portrait view, and 3 new wallpapers designed for landscape. All in HD. And LOTS of icons to choose from.App icon labels can also be hidden on the same settings page. Examples can be seen on the screenshots. An invisible icon is also included for more flexible customisation and placement of app icons.If wallpaper is set to scroll on portrait mode, it is best to set an odd number (1,3, 5 or 7 etc) of screens for icons to align with the wallpaper's LCARS design.Feel free to experiment with the different wallpapers, wallpaper mode (scrolls with screen or fixed), under Preferences->Visual settings->Backgrounds and many other Go Launcher features.As much as I would like to, I am unable to add sounds to the theme, as I am limited to what Go Launcher Ex can do.To Apply the ThemeOn the Go Launcher homescreen, select Menu > Theme > Installed themes, choose the theme and apply it to your phone. To Change Wallpaper- Click Menu > Wallpaper, and select Go Wallpaper where you can select the theme's background you prefer.To Change App Icons (over 88 choices in the latest version)- Long press and release on app icon > Replace > Theme\u2019s icon, and then choose the icon you prefer. Feel free to contact me if you have any problems or suggestions for the theme. Please let me try to help you, before leaving any negative comments or ratings. I have been very encouraged by the 5-star positive ratings and positive reviews, and will try to improve this as much as possible. Feel free to go to my webpage listed below to give suggestions.

Check before purchase. **If you already have GO Launcher installed, it may say it has stopped when opening, but it's fine.

Whether you are a serious Trekkie / Trekker or just enjoy a nice sci-fi look, you should love this theme. Looks great on phones or tablets. (portrait and landscape)This theme comes with 9 wallpapers 7 app drawer wallpapers, 3 dock backgrounds, 11 common icon backgrounds, and 120+ icons for replacing icon images on the desktop and folders.

SMS go to settings -> Advanced -> other settingand make sure \"Disable other message notification\" is not active.HTC One X owners that are not seeing flash notifications on incoming calls should update to lates firmware from HTC (Jelly Bean).Known issues:- Samsung galaxy nexus will probably not be supported due to weird flash restrictions from Samsung (Camera preview must be rendered to screen).- Some motorola and LG devices might have issues. please let me know via mail if you experience problems.- Some versions of Samsung devices will not work at the moment. this includes some versions of the S2 (Samsung is shipping 9(!) different versions of the S2).In any case, try the app and if it fails, hit Refund in yje plasy store within 15 minutes to get an automatic refund.

The app not works now on android 4.1+, send us more info as possible so we can fix it.AT FIRST START OF THE APP BE SURE THAT YOUR PHONE CAN GO ONLINE!!!This is not an app! It's a font pack. You can use these fonts in another app such as Handcent SMS or other text Apps or if you want to change the font of the Android menu and System you MUST use a custom Launcher (as GO Launcher EX)In this app you can see an advice and can preview the fonts only. You cannot set them from the app menu. You must search them from an external app.Every app has a different search method for the fonts. This app was tested with Hancent SMS and to scan for new fonts you have to go inSettings -> Custom Style -> Scan external font package. Then you have to go in Bubble setting to choose the font that you like in this pack. In Bubble setting chose Incoming Font and set as source this app '500 Best Fonts by IronWolf'.My advice is to 'Move to SD card' the app in order to reduce A LOT the space used by this app (from 11,44 MB  -> to 64 KB)Thanks!//COMMENT ANSWERS (anyway fell free to send me emails)jamie on 1 feb 2012 said:HOWS COME??

Thank you for all your support!Praise for Heart Container Battery Meter:- \"Totally awesome.\" - Chris Parsons of Android Central- \"Quite awesomely 8-bit retro...just makes my nerd heart happy.\" - Paul E King of Good and EvoHeart Container Battery Widget is like having an 8-bit or 16-bit health bar for your phone with many styles to choose from! Fans of old school gaming will recognize this app as a life meter similar to Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, Scott Pilgrim, and many other video games. This health bar, however, is used to indicate remaining battery life. As the phone's battery takes damage(discharges), the hearts are depleted piece by piece just like a video game.While charging your phone, the life meter will animate as it refills!This battery widget is light on resources and uses no battery. The app only updates when the system updates the battery percentage.Heart Container is a widget. Meaning it will not show up like a normal app.To add Heart Container to your phone's home screen(these directions will vary depending on device:1. Find an empty spot on your home screen.2. Press and hold your finger on an empty spot until a menu appears.3. Select \"Add Widget\" or \"Widget\".4. Scroll down until you see Heart Container on the list and select it.5. Enjoy Heart Container!Email me if you have problems. Please don't leave problems as a comment. I can't reply to comments which means I can't help you. Leaving bad feedback before asking for help is bad etiquette.A big THANK YOU for downloading this app and all the support. I am humbled by all the positive reviews.Explanation of the Wi-Fi permissions:Some apps require a ton of permissions and some of those permissions sound pretty scary. As an Android user myself, I want to know why an app I am using needs each app permission before installing so I am going to explain Heart Container's permissions for everyone's benefit. Heart Container Battery Meter only has permission to see if the Wi-Fi is on/off and to enable/disable Wi-Fi, but only if the user physically does so. Heart Container does not have access to any network. Google has labelled Android's app permissions in such a way that the permissions look like they allow more access than they really do(for some of them). This app's permissions are \"Network Communication: Access Wi-Fi State\" and \"Network Communication: Change Wi-Fi State\".

Would you like to block text messages and calls from someone?  Would you like to be able to secure your text messages from anyone and everyone with a password protected decoy app?  Are you looking for the coolest text messaging app out there? Well, here\u2019s your answer!Hide text messages for unlimited contacts safely with a password protected \u201cDecoy App\u201d.  Once you download this app it will place an \u201cInvisible\u201d icon in your app drawer. Hide text messages from selected contacts in this app. These text messages will not be put in \u201cregular\u201d text message apps. Text messages in the app are completely separate and secure. When text messages are received, you get a notification in the status bar that says, \u201cSubscription notice,\u201d which makes it look like it has a \u201csubscription error.\u201d Only you will know it\u2019s a notification for a text message. You can switch contacts when needed. Don\u2019t worry - once a contact is removed it will not put hidden text messages in your \u201cregular\u201d text messaging box. Does not transfer existing messages \u2013 the two areas are completely separate!  Does not support MMS\u2026The hide call log feature allows you to add the contact and all incoming, outgoing and missed calls will be deleted from your regular call logs.  You must place the outgoing call from inside the app and you have the choice of saving your call logs inside the app!!!The Block text messaging feature will allow you to block incoming text messages. You have the option to save the blocked text messages so you can read them after you \u201cunblock\u201d the contact. Or we can discard the text messages as they come in. You can still send text messages to the contact while they are blocked. We have added the \u201cCall Blocker\u201d feature for that contact that is really a pain. We also give you the choice to save the call log for these blocked calls or we can discard them as they come in for you.It does not remove or change your \u201cregular\u201d text message icon in the app drawer. This is a decoy application that allows you to hide text or block calls and text messages with password protection. This is similar to CATE - Call and Text Eraser, or Shady SMS.It is a totally blank icon.
