The inbuilt map provides the official TFL map of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. This provides the best of both worlds, the transport map and route planning anytime, anywhere and online street maps and search when a connection is available. \u25cf ROUTING \u25cf Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.

Service runs every 7 minutes\u201d which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey. \u25cf NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED \u25cf The tube map and routing do not require an internet connection and therefore you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution. \u25cf LIVE INFO \u25cf When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays. Unique to this application is the ability to turn off services that are out of action and automatically calculate an alternative route. \u25cf MINUTE MAP \u25cf This unique feature provides a view of travel times from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. \u25cf MORE MAPS \u25cf This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information.

{"title": "mAIS - Ship Position Reporting", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=dlek", "rating": "4.083135604858398", "Description": " Are you sailing out of the range of MarineTraffic AIS receivers? Your vessel does not have an AIS transponder? Use your smart phone on board to report the positions of the vessel to MarineTraffic.mAIS is a mobile application that makes possible to use your mobile device to report the positions of a vessel to MarineTraffic. GPS-enabled devices (iPhone/iPad and Android) can be used to report the position, the details and the status of a vessel in case an AIS transponder is not available or the vessel is out of the range of MarineTraffic's AIS receivers.Intended useThe positions of a vessel will be reported if the application is started on the mobile device and whenever Internet connectivity is available. The position reporting will continue even if the app is running at the background on the device. This application is intended to be used only as a vessel's reporting tool and not as a personal location reporting tool. Therefore, it is important to be used only when the device is on board a vessel and it must be switched off whenever the device leaves the vessel.This is not AISmAIS simulates the data transmitted by AIS transponders, however it only transmits data through the Internet and not through AIS radio-frequencies. It is clear that the information transmitted by mAIS is not visible by the AIS receivers of other vessels. It will be only displayed on MarineTraffic web site and apps. As such, mAIS is only a ship's self-reporting tool that does not substitute real AIS transmissions and it is not by any means related to the safety and navigation equipment of a vessel.GPS-enabled DevicesmAIS will work on GPS-enabled Android devices, as long as the 'Location Services' are enabled. It may not work properly on iPod or iPad WiFi, as these devices do not have built-in GPS and the position reports may be not accurate.Battery consumptionmAIS is continuously using the GPS of your device in order to report its positions. In most cases this is a power intensive operation and it will exhaust the battery of your device in a few hours. It is recommended to have your device plugged-in whenever you are using mAIS.How to use itA valid account registered at marinetraffic.com is required in order to start position reporting through the mAIS application. Register at http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/alerts.aspx The app must be configured to use the registered email and password as well as all valid details of the reporting vessel. A valid MMSI number together with the other details of the vessel (such as vessel's name, call-sign, dimensions, destination, ETA, etc) must be also configured in the app.What if the vessel does not have a MMSI number assigned?MMSI number is the key value for position reporting. A valid MMSI number, configured in mAIS app, is required in order to send position reports to MarineTraffic. It is possible that smaller vessels have not been assigned a MMSI number by their authorities. In this case you are still able to use mAIS, after having registered your vessel for a unique vessel's ID at this form on marinetraffic.com.E-mail notificationsIn order to avoid unwanted position reporting, MarineTraffic will send e-mail notifications at your registered e-mail address, whenever your app is active. This serves as a reminder that position reporting should only be active when you are at sea and must be turned off when at land.Bandwidth consumptionThe bandwidth consumed by mAIS is minimal. Even if mAIS is configured to send position reports at the highest frequency, it will use about 150 bytes/minute, which means about 210KB in one day or 6MB for a whole month of continuous use.

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance travelled such as walking, running, driving, boating, hiking, and horseback riding. Please note that the home screen widget is for the full version only.This description is auto translated Click to read the original English description***** Important! *****Common user mistakes:- Do not try to test the app by pacing around in the same small area.- Please note that GPS uses a lot of battery power.- Satellite based GPS location does not work well indoors.  Many apps use network based location because it does work indoors, but it is not accurate enough for use with this app.  If the location icon is not solid in your status bar, that means your PHONE can't acquire a satellite GPS fix in that area.Features:- accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.- includes a timer- includes pause / resume for each trip- includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset/stop/start of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in 9 seconds, or you can lock it yourself.- includes displacement readout (straight line distance from your starting point)- average speed readout in meters per second, feet per second, yards per second, kilometres per hour, miles per hour, nautical miles per hour- actual speed readout (This may not be accurate at slow walking speeds)- units include meters, kilometres, yards, feet, miles and nautical miles- approximates distance travelled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.- resumes tracking after restart (You must now enable this feature in settings)- includes a custom calculator.  Uses include taxi fare and energy burned while exercising What this app does NOT do:1) Does not record your route.  Each trip has a start location, a last location, and a next-to-last location.  No record of where you go is saved other than that.  Only distance and time.2) No location information ever leaves your device.3) No maps.

Some of the features will be integrated into SpeedView in the following months. Sorry for the inconvenience. ---InDrive is a unique application that combines car mode functionality with an advanced trip computer and deep Poweramp integration. With one-touch access to the most useful features on your phone, this app is your perfect driving companion!*** This is a free 30-day trial version. In order to continue using the app after this period, you will need to purchase the InDrive Unlocker.InDrive makes it very easy to launch your favorite applications, directly dial numbers, view your trip information and control music playback*. It will auto launch when placed in a compatible car dock. If you don't have a physical car dock, InDrive provides an option to force your phone into car mode, which will allow the app to override the Home button. Please note that for this feature to work properly on Android 2.x and higher, you have to set InDrive as the default car dock app. To do this, simply check the \"Enable car mode\" option in the settings and follow the instructions. This only needs to be done once.NOTE FOR ANDROID 4.2.x USERS: Unfortunately, it appears that Google has removed dock home support in Android 4.2. Pressing the Home button will now return you to the launcher screen instead of InDrive or other car home app of choice. If you want this feature back, please vote for the following issue: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39662* The music screen is designed to work in conjunction with Poweramp. Without Poweramp installed, you will only be able to do very basic controls such as switching to the next song in the default Android music player. Support for other media players is not guaranteed.Trip computer features:* Street address* Speedometer (mph, km/h or knots)* Heading* Battery level* Weather (Fahrenheit or Celsius)* Odometer* Time traveled (total / driving / stopped)* Average speed (total / driving)* Max speed* Elevation* Time of dayStartup options:\u2022 Enable car mode (Force the phone into car mode like it had been placed in the car dock)\u2022 Check GPS status (Open the location settings screen if GPS is disabled)\u2022 Turn on Bluetooth\u2022 Disable Wi-Fi\u2022 Set media volume (Does not affect the ringtone volume)\u2022 Set screen brightness (Will override the automatic brightness setting if necessary)Other settings:\u2022 Keep screen on (Prevent the screen from locking while the app is running)\u2022 Disable auto rotation (Turn this option on when driving on bumpy roads)\u2022 Turn on speakerphone\u2022 Mute notification sounds\u2022 Vibrate on press\u2022 Minimum accuracy\u2022 Filter the GPS speed\u2022 Run in the background\u2022 Enable track logging\u2022 Exit on undockKNOWN ISSUES: If you are experiencing a problem where the app randomly closes without any errors, try disabling integration with Poweramp in the app settings. This is a confirmed problem in Poweramp that unfortunately affects InDrive due to the link between two applications. It should be fixed in the next Poweramp update. BATTERY USAGE: This app is very battery intensive when used with the default settings. When not connected to a power source, please uncheck the \"Keep screen on\" option in the app settings.NOTE ON PERMISSIONS: InDrive requires access to several system features, such as GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, audio settings, and also to the SD card in order to write temporary log files and map images (these will be deleted on uninstall). It also requires a permission to directly call phone numbers for the shortcuts screen to work properly.If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them on our blog or open a support ticket here: http://support.codesector.com/  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codesector.indrive", "price": "0", "date_published": "January 8, 2014", "email": "indrive@codesector.com", "downloads": "50,000 - 100,000", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Code Sector", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://codesector.com/indrive&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHme5R-zAODCwebF7sQwkPfL8umuQ", "reviewers": "586"}

In this case, the primary performance calculations made \u200b\u200bby MAF at idle RPM, and then comes the calculation based on the time of injection and the engine speed (ie, at the time of setting MAF should be OK). To fine-tune your reading rate there is the correction factor, witch can be calculated as the ratio of the amount actually spent fuel to the amount of spent fuel that shows the program.

{"title": "BRouter Offline Navigation", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Dr.+Arndt+Brenschede", "rating": "3.931034564971924", "Description": " Configurable, elevation-aware (bike-) Router for OFFLINE Navigation based on Open-Street-Map ( OSM)  Data. Works in conjunction with a (OSM-) Map Application, e.g. OsmAnd, Locus-Maps or Oruxmaps.See http://brouter.de/brouter for more documenationSee http://brouter.de/brouter-web for an online version.*** If you do not know one of OsmAnd, Locus-Maps or Oruxmaps, then the BRouter-App is useless for you. Download only if you are willing to spend some time to understand the setup. No one-star reviews from the unpatient please! email for problems ***BRouter does only the plain route-calculation and does not display a map or the calculated route on it's own and therefore works only together with a Map Application. There are two different methods for the interfacing between BRouter and the Map application: BRouter offers a service interface that is called by the map application without a need to start the BRouter-App. This way, BRouter is a routing service very much like an online routing service, including dynamic recalculations if you get off the track. The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application's waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application's tracks directory. Locus and Oruxmaps support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play. OsmAnd supports the service interface starting from version 1.7, while the waypoint interface is supported in older revisions as well.The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it's use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the \"Server-Mode\" Button. This feature is called \"timeout-free recalculations\". The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. \"nogo200\"  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.The Google-Play Version of BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available. If you do not want to allow internet access (that is needed by download manager only), you can use the pure offline APK from the distribution ZIP from the project homepage.The mapping from one of the 6 routing modes (car/bike/foot * fast/short), that are used traditionally by routing services, and BRouter's concept of fully configurable routing profiles get's the following default mapping after the installation of BRouter: car-fast -> car-testcar-short -> mopedbike-fast -> fastbikebike-short -> trekkingfoot-fast -> shortestfoot-short -> shortestThis mapping, however, can by changed anytime via the \"Server-Mode\" Button of the BRouter App. But also the routing profile definitions can be changed or new ones can be created.Routing for cars is is currently available only in an experimental state (\"car-test\") and is not recommend. For example, turn-restriction are not taken into account. Car routing for longer distances needs the the download of the \"carsubset\" datafiles, while for bike routing, you only need the normal (\"full\") routing data files.

Friendly user interface.The Stockholm subway system including metro(Swedish: Stockholms tunnelbana), train, tram, local courts,  is a railway system in Stockholm, Sweden. The first metro line opened in 1950, and today the system has 100 stations in use, of which 47 are underground and 53 above ground. The Subway, Trains, Trams, Local Court, going through the Stockholm City Centre.The 105.7 kilometres (65.7 mi) long metro system is owned by the Stockholm County Council through Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL). The operation is contracted to MTR Corporation.There are more than 100 stations in use in the Stockholm Subway system. One station, Kymlinge, was built but never taken into use. One station has been taken out of use and demolished. The Bagarmossen old surface station was demolished and replaced with a new underground station there instead, this prior to the metro extension to the Skarpn\u00e4ck metro station.The Stockholm subway is well known for its decoration of the stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world. Several of the stations (especially on the Blue Line) are left with the bedrock exposed, crude and unfinished, or as part of the decorations. At Rissne, an informative wall fresco about the history of Earth's civilizations runs along both sides of the platform.In 2013, it was announced that agreement had been reached on the future of several extensions, with construction projected to start in 2016 and revenue service on the first sections projected to begin in 2020.Extension of the blue line southwards from Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden. There will be a new station at Sofia on Sodermalm, after which the line splits with one branch continuing to Nacka (with three new intermediate stations), and the other to new underground platforms at Gullmarsplan after which it will take over the current green line branch to Hags\u00e4tra. This allows higher frequencies on the Green line branches to Farsta strand and Skarpn\u00e4ck which are currently limited by the need to split the service onto three branches.Extension of the blue line north-west from Akalla to Barkarby railway station via one new station.Construction of a new fourth metro line, initially consisting of a short three station line running north from Odenplan via the new development at Hagastaden and ending in Arenastaden. This is planned for eventual extension to Danderyd and T\u00e4by in the north-east, interchanging with the existing Red line to M\u00f6rby centrum.Keyword: Stockholm subway, Stockholm metro, subway,train, bus, sl, transport, Best\u00e4lla sms-biljett, real time, T-centralen  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tanggod.sthlmsubway", "price": "0", "date_published": "September 17, 2014", "email": "tanggod@gmail.com", "downloads": "1,000 - 5,000", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Tanggod", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "3.0 and up", "reviewers": "47"}

A huge world wide database of DME's, VOR's and VORTAC's is built in. Both a VOR (VHF Omni-directional Range) and HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) can be simulated. Both also have a classic 7-segment simulated DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) displayed consisting of slant distance, groundspeed and ETA. The simulator utilises GPS and the device's magnetic compass to accurately display the VOR or HSI magnetic radial (corrected for the local magnetic variation). The simulator is intended for training purposes only and must not be used for actual aircraft navigation. It is ideal for learning how the VOR and HSI work in convenient location other than an aircraft cockpit.The trial version is limited to displaying the simulated radio navigation aid instrument for 45 seconds only before returning to the main selection screen. If your devices GPS has trouble locking within the 45 seconds limit then first get an initial GPS lock with Google Maps.

It will help you to learn and understand more about your vehicle. When you want detailed information about a particular button or switch, simply point the camera of your smartphone at that object or area containing the object. An interactive pop up appears on the screen of your phone and with a single touch you are quickly provided with the information you require. When a warning light is displayed on your vehicle's combination meter, the Nissan Qashqai Driver's guide provides you with quick access to additional information. Point the camera of your phone at the combination meter and with a single touch, you will have access to an explanation of all the warning lights. You can also touch the dedicated warning light icon on the main screen. The application provides the following features: 1. An Augmented Reality function that recognizes vehicle content through the camera of your smartphone. This technology interacts with 3 main areas of the vehicle: \u00b7        Steering wheel \u00b7        Navigation and Audio system \u00b7        Climate control system 2. Descriptions of all the warning lights displayed on the vehicle\u2019s combination meter. 3. An electronic version of the Quick Reference Guide, providing a brief overview of many important features of the vehicle.NoteThe Augmented Reality interacts with these main buttons and systems:  1. Steering wheel buttons  2. Audio system buttons  3. Navigation system buttons  4. Air Conditioning buttons  5. Parking Brake button  6. Combination meter  7. Start/Stop engine button  8. Buttons located between the steering wheel and the driver's door  To take the best advantage of the Augmented Reality, you should be aware of the following points: 1. Use the application with sufficient exterior light conditions. 2. Always focus the camera on the complete button area of your vehicle. For instance in the case of the climate  control and radio panel, please make sure the whole set of buttons is displayed within the screen. 3. If the camera does not immediately recognize the button area, please point the camera at the area again. Or move forwards and backwards slowly until the camera recognizes the element. 4. The Augmented Reality may not work correctly if reflections appear on the surface of the dashboard or sunlight goes directly into the camera lens. 5. In dark conditions, you can use the Augmented Reality function by switching on the flash light. 6. Depending on your smartphone model, the battery charge level, and the intensity of the flash light, the Augmented Reality may not work correctly.

If you encounter some odd behaviour of the attitude indicator (e.g. with the Google Nexus 7) please follow these steps to get satisfying results:1) Launch ixGyro and select the Settings dialog2) Check the option \"Minimize gyro delay\"3) Select the option \"Reset Autocalibration\" from the main menu4) Wait at least 5 minutes while ixGyro is running and the device is at rest5) Optionally you can uncheck the option \"Minimize gyro delay\" now to save battery power.Please read the documentation carefully and contact us in case of problems!This is a demo version!

Thank You to Timothy Nathan===============================================================Watch the example video of on an actual ILS: www.youtube.com/watch?v=85AdUUd-kZwWe are approaching the localiser on a 125 heading and a TOD altitude of 1200ft. We are about 60 ft too low. The Green, White and Yellow arrows show the direction to the TOD point, the touchdown zone and the approach course respectively.As the localizer comes in we turn to 207 for the intercept.As we approach the TOD the Green and Yellow GP merge. The green arrow swings around to the left indicating that we pass TOD on the right.The decent with the GP starts. The white arrow is now hidden behind the yellow arrow. The TOD is now behind us and hence the green arrow is pointing to our 6 o' clock position.The voice announcement are suppressed. However you can see the announcements in the upper left of the phone screen. \"Up 80\" for example. The app shows an altitude of 510 ft at touchdown. According to the charts the runway is at 517 ft.Once we pass the touchdown zone the white arrow moves to the 6 o'clock position.Note, we used an external Bluetooth GPS on the glare shield with a 5 Hz update frequency. Any change in color of the \"accuracy\" field indicates a new GPS data point. CAUTION, usage of the internal phone GPS may materially reduce the accuracy.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqyAXyufBK8&feature=youtu.be shows a good match between GPS and ILS. At 1000 ft agl the tower switches the approach from circle to land to straight in. Compare the two glide slopes.Further comparison of the app to an actual ILS:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLHkozNBRwCourchevel with Audio announcement for altitude correction: www.youtube.com/watch?v=P__OlISD3xgScenic Courchevel (LFLJ) approach: www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNFNFZq2BFYThe app asks for the pilots e-mail address. The address is attached to log files and makes it possible to send comments back. Privacy is ensured. Upload/download of data may best be done when connected to internet via wifi. The data stays private.To add more approaches drop me an e-mail or press the request button on the phone. 37,000 approaches can be down loaded via \"Menu->Download Approaches\".Comments to: dierk@reuter-family.com Disclaimer: The software and data is as is.

This speedometer software features a retro design and has a warning chime function for over speeding. It sounds an alarm chime* when the vehicle exceeds the set speed limit.*The application software is named after the \"dingdong\" alarm sound (sounds like \"kin-kon\" or \"king-kong\" when expressed in Japanese).\u2501\u2501 What is the speed warning chime? \u2501\u2501It was mandatory for all Japanese vehicles to be equipped with speed alarms between 1974 and 1986. Reminding you of the chime sounds of those days, this speed alarm is used to make you pay attention to the vehicle\u2019s speed when you exceed a certain limit (ordinary passenger car: approx. 100 km/h, light car: approx. 80km/h).\u2501\u2501 Target users \u2501\u2501\u2605Persons who want to be aware of the moving speed and distance while driving/riding a car, bus, train, or bicycle and jogging or walking.\u2605Persons who want to control the moving speed.\u2605Persons who long for the nostalgic \u201cdingdong\u201d speed alarm sounds of the Japanese cars of 1974 to 1986.\u2501\u2501 Features \u2501\u2501\u2605Speedometer When the Android device receives Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signals, the speedometer displays your current speed. You can use the lower right switch to change the display unit between \"km/h\" and \"MPH.\"The meter can display speeds between 0 and 180km/h (MPH).For Pro version, there is an additional function (provided at a charge) that allows you to set the highest speed from four selections (60, 180, 240, and 360).The left side indicator (satellite icon) among the indicators under the meter informs you of the receiving status of GPS satellite signals. The indicator lights red when you are in a place such as a building or tunnel that blocks reception of GPS satellite signals. It turns green when GPS satellite signals can be received properly. \u2605Speed warning chime When you exceed the set speed limit, the speed warning indicator under the screen lights red and the application sounds a \u201cdingdong\u201d speed warning chime at the same time.You can change the setting speed by tapping the Setting button and moving the red needle displayed on the screen with your finger. The speed-warning chime may sound slightly off-tempo sometimes because this speedometer attempts to reproduce the feel of the 70s and 80s chimes. This is not a bug. This application software does not have a volume adjustment function. Use the volume control on the Android device to adjust the sound.\u2605Travelling distanceThe meter displays the distance that has been traveled while this application software is turned on. The distance is measured in kilometers (or miles).The upper display shows the odometer. This value cumulates until you uninstall the application software.The lower display shows the trip meter.

Parking Zone? Street signs? It's up to you! * Applicable only if your device has a camera- Share your spot - Meeting friends/family in a crowded parking lot at the mall or an amusement park?

Set a reminder which will notify you before it costs you. One single saved parking ticket pays for the app ten times over!- Color themes - Everyone loves to customize.  Favorite team colors?  Hot pink and yellow?  Go for it!Note: This app takes advantage of the Global Positioning System, which provides the most accurate read of your current location based on satellites in orbit around the Earth.

domes, ambushes GBDD and potentially dangerous places on the road.MapcamDroid will remind of compliance with traffic rules and speed limits, and help avoid an accident or a fine.MapcamDroid can work both independently and with any navigation software in the background.Using the application has been tested in conjunction with programs Navitel, iGO, City Guide, Yandex, Yandeks.Navigator, Google maps, NAVIGON, Sygic GPS Navigation, and others.The program uses a warning project http://mapcam.info.At this point, it is the most complete and current database of the countries of the CIS and beyond. Available database of more than 80 countries.***** The program uses two types of databases warnings, the \"Standard\" and \"Advanced.\"In the \"standard\" database includes the following warnings:\u00a01. The static camera, measuring the speed of\u00a02. Camera, built-in lights\u00a03. Checking camera running a red light\u00a04. Steam bath chamber on the segment of the road\u00a05. Mobile camera (ambush)The \"advanced\" than those listed above, include:\u00a06. Camera control strip shuttle transport\u00a07. Stationary traffic police post\u00a08. Crossing\u00a09. Unsafe pedestrian crossing or school zone\u00a010. Home of the Community\u00a011. Speed \u200b\u200blimit sign\u00a012. Bumps\u00a013. Bad road\u00a014. Dangerous change of direction\u00a015. Dangerous intersection\u00a016. Another dangerIf the program ***** requests authorization after every reboot of the device:Chances are you've had a program on a memory card (SD).Programs that use the system accounts can not be transferred to the memory card. Otherwise, when unmounting a card or reboot the phone account, the phone automatically deleted and will have to enter a username and password again.This is a feature of Android.***** No need to write in the comments that the program do not have any cameras or information about them showing up lateAt least in the major cities in the base chamber fall substantially on the day of installation.No application chamber may be caused by several factors.1. The camera is not related to fixing traffic violations. These cameras are not entered into the database.You do not want to be notified about all the security cameras, which are now hanging on each entrance.2. Maybe it's a fake. Fake differ from these cameras lack of toppings, apparently they are completely identical.Such objects are also removed from the database.3. Perhaps this is the camera commit violations of the lane from.Such cameras are in the program, but they work only with the \"extended\" version of the database. If you have a \"standard\" base, warnings about such cameras will not.How to install an expanded database, read our discussion forum.Check whether there is a camera in the program and read more information about it, please visit. http://mapcam.info/speedcam/If the cameras are really not in the database then it can be added on the same page with a convenient visual interface.Distance ***** warning said in the database for each individual object.This helps to minimize the number of false positives and alert the driver exactly where it is really needed.Change the warning distance of each object on the page you can http://mapcam.info/speedcam/If you have enough experience to self-edit, just write in the comments to the subject that you need to increase the range.The more experienced members would always be corrected.Get more information about the program, and you can ask questions in our discussion forum: http://mapcam.info/forum/index.php?topic=1525.0The version for iOS can be found at the link: https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/mapcam-info-rus/id644832729  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.mapcam.droid", "price": "0", "date_published": "September 11, 2014", "email": "mapcam.info@gmail.com", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Mapcam.info", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mapcam.info&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEkRELadzUpznCM4TKoq0h8Z66few", "reviewers": "7130"}

{"title": "Flight Map FREE", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Makro+Productions", "rating": "3.6666667461395264", "Description": " YOU CAN DO IT ON A PLANE!There is a paid version Flight Map, that includes database of world airports, estimated time of arrival and recording of the route flown that can be shared on social networks, so after you have tried the Flight Map FREE, you might consider upgrading. Or, you might consider upgrading to Flight Map HD, which has much more detailed map of the world.Flight Map FREE is a unique application that works as your own personal flight tracker (Sky map) while flying in an airplane. It shows where you currently are, speed, altitude and some other information about your flight. You can also see and name the landmarks on the way, so that you know what you see from your window.Flight Map FREE also displays visible and used GPS / GLONASS satellites, so you can use it as a GPS testing tool. The GPS function works when your phone is in airplane mode, because it does not broadcast any radio, it rather listens to the GPS satellites only.Features include:- Real time position of the plane on the map- Zoomable world map not dependent on a connection to internet- Your own personal flight tracker- Works when your phone is in Airplane mode, so it can be used anytime while in flight- Dark / Light skin- Metric / Imperial units- Multilanguage (currently English, Spanish, Portugese, French, Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Czech, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Hungarian)- Map can be fullscreen or split screen with real time flight data- GPS / GLONASS Satellites real time display depending on your device capabilities- Sunrise and sunset at present positionPlease note that Flight Map FREE is heavily dependent on the quality of your device's GPS capabilities. If your device is capable of A-GPS (Assisted GPS), please run the application while on the ground, so that the satellites' positions get downloaded from the internet, it will be much easier for the device to pick up signal when in the air. Please share your experience with various devices. Most of the time Flight Map FREE works perfectly when sitting in a window seat and does not work too good when sitting two seats from the window or more. In any case we recommend to move the device to the window, let it pick up the satellites signal first and then try how far from the window it can pick up the signal. The screen showing the visible and used satellites is designed to help you with this.If your device is capable of receiving GLONASS signal, the satellites are shown with a differently colored border. If you want to translate Flight Map FREE into your language (or correct our translation), please contact the developer. The first run of the application takes a while because it needs to unpack the whole world map to be able to display it.Polish translation thanks to Tomasz PrycaHungarian translation thanks to Dr. Istvan Lunczer  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=marko.android.flightmapfree", "price": "0", "date_published": "May 4, 2014", "email": "makro.productions@haulis.com", "downloads": "1,000 - 5,000", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Makro Productions", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "3.0 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.haulis.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFucNh0hVVGWedXE8vRnVOhs_GqyA", "reviewers": "30"}

{"title": "Arrow - Where is my car Trial", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Mark+Pfluger", "rating": "3.857142925262451", "Description": " Arrow automatically saves your parking location every time you leave your car -- without you having to do anything. So now you can always check how long ago you parked or how long you drove. The history allows you to go back in time and see where you have been. And, of course, if you forget where you parked, Arrow can guide you back to your car.* This is the 14-day Trial version of Arrow *Features \u2022 Automatically saves your parking spots \u2022 Manually add parking spots \u2022 Directions to your car \u2022 History of past parking spots \u2022 Bluetooth and CarDock support \u2022 Minimal battery usage \u2022 Accuracy usually within 50 feet/15m (except parking garages due to limited GPS signal)How does it work?Arrow uses your phone's sensors -- the accelerometer and the magnetometer -- in combination with GPS to determine when you are driving and when you leave your car.Battery usageArrow minimizes the use of GPS and other resources to give you an almost unnoticeable effect on battery life.IssuesArrow works as described on about 85% of phones (100% if you are using Bluetooth or CarDock mode). There are thousands of different Android phones, firmware versions, sensor chips and GPS chips, so some problems are inevitable.There are two reasons why Arrow can not save parking spots: 1) Some phones turn off the sensors when you turn the screen off. Arrow does not work when that happens, but you will get a message alerting you about the problem. It will still work in CarDock or Bluetooth mode. This doesn't apply to modded phones.Phones that shut down the sensors when the screen is off:\u2022 Motorola Defy\u2022 Motorola Atrix\u2022 Motorola Droid Bionic\u2022 Motorola Droid X2\u2022 LG 800\u2022 Lenovo Indigo\u2022 Huawei U8510\u2022 HTC Evo 4G\u2022 HTC Hero\u2022 HTC One S2) On some phones the accelerometer is not well-calibrated. You can manually calibrate it in the settings, but this is a bit of a trial-and-error process. If you have trouble with this, please send an email to support for instructions.SupportWe will try to help you with any problem you may encounter with Arrow.PrivacyParking spots are saved on your device and are accessible only to you.

{"title": "OpenFlightGPS", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Roger+Leuthner", "rating": "4", "Description": " Downloadable geo-referenced (moving map) aviation charts for the CONTIGUOUS 48 United States: Sectional, WAC, Enroute Low, Terminal Area; also includes non-geo-referenced VFR flyways charts.  Simple course lines are supported along with display of various data such as GPS latitude, longitude, speed, altitude, bearing, etc.OpenFlightGPS (then released in 2010 as \"OpenFlight Map\") was the FIRST Android Aviation Charting App available.  I created this app because there were no Android chart options at the time; and continue to service the app with FAA charts as provided on the FAA \"aeronav\" web site.  The charts are provided in their entirety, and as such are clearly marked with their effective dates and all other margin information.  You must download the charts one at a time as this app is provided to you at my personal expense and as such I would rather not have folks downloading 10 gigs at a pop from my website for charts they probably won't look at.This application is absolutely free and free of any advertising or other garbage*.  If OpenFlightGPS doesn't work for you or you don't like it for any reason, delete it.  If you're nice, I might respond to emailed suggestions.  Bad ranking in general will not get any result, and you'll just prove what kind of entitled person (or maybe representative of one of the paid vendors ...) you are.Works best on 10\" tablets, also works with 7\" and other form factor tablets and most cell phones - but many cell phones do not have good GPS reception without \"cell tower\" assist.The complete set is about 150 charts - note that the application may initialize more slowly if a very large number of charts is cached.  Add to or change your set of charts at any time via WIFI download from within the app.  Geo-referenced, moving map technology including access to all (1) Sectional (VFR), (2) World Aeronautical (WAC), (3) Enroute Low (IFR) and (4) Terminal Area (TAC) Charts for the contiguous 48 United States.  Also includes non-Geo-Referenced Fly Way Charts.  Individual charts are downloaded on demand through the app; individual chart files are between 2 and 10 megabytes, so WIFI works best when caching maps.When moving, \"GPS Mode\" shows graphic (miniature airplane with pointer) pointing in direction of movement.  When stopped, graphic changes to a house icon.  \"Compass Mode\" shows the direction ON THE MAP that the device is pointed.  Also shows current latitude, longitude and altitude and current map scale.To the guy from one of the hardware vendors that writes in the comments of all the free/low cost aviation charting apps about \"wanting someone you can sue if there's a problem ... blah blah ... skin in the game\" : The license terms you agreed to specifically disallow using this application in flight, or for any Aeronautical Decision Making whatsoever.  I do appreciate that you are touched by this free application, as the primary reason I am giving it away is that I am sick and tired of overpriced map updates for most of the paid (and all of the certified) products  ...  Foreflight is an exception, and is reasonably priced ... if you don't want plates, anyway.  Too bad they don't sell it on an open platform.As per the license terms installing and using this application affirms that you agree that \"Roger B. Leuthner is not responsible in any way for your use of this program in any respect\", which you must agree to when activating the application on your device.OpenFlight is a trademarked name, and is not part of the OpenFlightGPS application.*Google is in the business of gathering and selling information about you.  Supporting Google by increasing the Android ecosystem with this free application is a necessary by-product of providing easy access to General Aviation pilots.

You can also setup your own tariffs: http://www.mytaxicontrol.com/tariffcompany.php and load them to your devices.myTaxiControl is the only app that is used by cab and limousine service drivers on a daily basis, as a replacement for a built-in taximeter device. It is the functionally richest and most accurate taximeter app available.Based on GPS, it is able to continuously update the fare amount during your taxi trip.It automatically selects the correct tariff applicable at that moment. Simply press \"GO!\" to start a new trip, and when your current location is supported, the taximeter will start to run. At the end of the trip, app will ask if you want to add a tip to the final fare.If you wish, app will open a window with options to deliver a personalised receipt to the passenger (mail, messenger, Wi-Fi Direct,\u2026)For taxi companies, there is a possibility to automatically call a given URL at each start and end of trip. This is useful for accounting purposes. If you have set your Preferences accordingly, app will ask for payment method and add it to this URL.myTaxiControl's database holds all tariff details needed to calculate a cab\u2019s fare with highest accuracy (flagfall, price per km/mile and/or time, slow traffic, thresholds, waiting mode, differentiate between day and night tariff, \u2026). Even loss of GPS signal situations are managed.All tariff details, including name (\"Paris:Lampe Blanche\", \"Singapore:Peak Hours-Normal Car\") are displayed. Drag pins on the map and  app will display the shortest route between the two pins (in green color) and give you a quote. Your negotiation position for a fixed price couldn't be any better! Internet connection is needed for this service. The route actually taken by the driver is displayed on the same map (in black color).The taximeter functionality doesn't need an Internet connection when database is loaded on the device. (It does that automatically when you launch the app for the first time).You get useful behaviour recommendations, like tipping practice or do\u2018s and don'ts. In almost all cities, app will tell you where you can complain should there be a problem with your taxi trip. You need to know where you are located? Simply click the location icon and you will get the full address. (Internet needed). myTaxiControl automatically generates files with details from your trip.

You must have Internet access and the latest Sygic (Aura v12 and higher) installed on your mobile device in order to use this app. HOW TO USE1) Tap on any place mark or search result in the Google Maps app and open place details. 2) Select \"Share\" and tap on \"Maps to Sygic\".3) Before navigation, always check if the location is correctly transferred to Sygic. This app relies on Google Maps and locations may not always perfectly match Sygic's.4) If the location you have selected is not properly transferred, try zooming in as much as you can in Google Maps and then share the location, or try sharing another location near where you want to go. *FAVORITE (STARRED) LOCATIONS ARE PARTIALLY SUPPORTED. Locations may not be correctly sent to Sygic and may be off by a few meters (or by hundreds)! Please zoom in as far as you can before sharing starred locations. Search results and other POIs work fine.IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ- This app requires the latest Sygic (Aura version 12 and higher) and a fairly new version of Google Maps. Not compatible with older Sygic versions.- Always check to see if the location is correctly transferred to Sygic.- Accuracy of locations may be off to a certain degree, especially with favorite (starred) items.- This is beta-quality software, so you can expect some glitches here and there. Error reports and suggestions are always welcome.REFUND POLICY- Please uninstall the app within 15 minutes of the initial download in order to receive a full refund automatically.- Your satisfaction is important to us. Even if you pass the 15-minute time frame, you're still eligible for a full refund. Please see next section for more details.LIMITED WARRANTY- If the app doesn't work for you or you're not fully satisfied in any aspect of the program, you can request a full refund within 30 days of your purchase. Please send us an email containing the order number and a brief explanation.- This app relies on third-party web services by Google. Although it's very unlikely that cloud services will be unavailable and the app will stop working, if it does, you're eligible for a full refund if you have purchased the app within the last 90 days. Please send us an email containing the order number and a brief explanation of the situation.- This app produces very accurate results; however, we cannot guarantee accuracy for all conversions. You are responsible for checking if the location has been transferred correctly to Sygic. Simply put, do not hit the road without checking the accuracy of the location first.PERMISSIONS- Internet Access: Google Maps doesn't provide coordinate information when you share places between applications. In order to save battery and data, the processing required to extract coordinate information is done in the cloud. The place information is sent to the server, and the app then receives the coordinate data. Remember, neither your location nor any other identifying information is ever sent to the cloud! Currently, less than a few kilobytes is required for each conversion.- Network Status: Required to check if you are connected to the Internet.TRADEMARKSGoogle Maps and Sygic are trademarks of their respective owners.

The inbuilt map provides the official TFL map of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. This provides the best of both worlds, the transport map and route planning anytime, anywhere and online street maps and search when a connection is available. \u25cf ROUTING \u25cf Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes. Comprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you \u201cdirection\u201d, \u201ctowards\u201d and \u201cservice frequency\u201d information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example \u201cTake the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes\u201d which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey. \u25cf NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED \u25cf The map and routing do not require an internet connection and therefore you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution. \u25cf LIVE INFO \u25cf When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays. Unique to this application is the ability to turn off services that are out of action and automatically calculate an alternative route. \u25cf MINUTE MAP \u25cf This unique feature provides a view of travel times from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. \u25cf MORE MAPS \u25cf This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information.

Most popular coastal areas in the US have cellular data access extending 12 or more miles out to sea. The UK has nearly complete coastal coverage out to 12 miles. AIS Ship data is provided by a network of voluntary AIS shore based stations. Some areas may not have AIS coverage.N.B. This is not an AIS transponder. You will not be visible to other ships on their AIS systems unless they also use data from the same land based AIS networks.Requirements:Android Smartphone or Tablet with GPS.Internet connection.You do not need an MMSI to use Boat Beacon and you can be seen on Boat Beacon by other Boat Beacon users without having one. However if you want to be seen on Global AIS systems like Marine Traffic, ShipFinder and AIS Hub, etc. then you will need to have and use an MMSI number. If you don't have an MMSI for your boat  you can obtain a free one in the US in a few minutes by visiting http://www.boatus.com/mmsi (the USCG approved agent) and using their online form. Alternatively email us for a free internet MMSI number. Please note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.NOT FOR NAVIGATIONThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful.

This is the only way that we can help to resolve errors for everyone. A bad rating and a \"don't work\" comment is not helpful.Virtual Dyno is a personal dyno software package that runs on Android 2.2 or higher. With Virtual Dyno you can play \"what if\" with your engine or chassis setup without buying the parts first. Virtual Dyno is designed to produce as close to \"real world\" results as possible, but it is also designed to be pessimistic in the numbers that it produces. That means that things like 1/4 mile times should be realistic enough to be achieved by an experienced driver familiar with the car. We have made every attempt to make Virtual Dyno produce numbers that you can not only achieve, but exceed. Not all variables can be estimated like this, so weather and track conditions can make a huge difference in actual results. Altitude also plays a role in the results. Virtual Dyno is calibrated for an altitude of 900 ft. above sea level, and an atmospheric pressure of 14.7.Virtual Dyno allows you to enter specifications about a particular engine/vehicle combination and calculates all needed information so that you can see what kind of performance to expect.  Virtual Dyno shows you true compression, engine CFM, total HP, NET HP, peak torque @ RPM, 1/4 mile performance, 60 foot times, and more. This version is based on our Virtual Dyno Pro software that has been used by machine shops and engine builders since 1995 to help their customers make informed choices before buying parts.Virtual Dyno allows you to play \"what if\" with any of the specs for a combination, to see how it effects the outcome. It is very accurate, and handles Nitrous Oxide kits and turbo or superchargers with ease.You can load engines from the supplied database, save new engines to the database, load and save files to the internal SD card, and even send your creations to a friend as a Virtual Dyno file so they can play with the file on their copy of Virtual Dyno. You can also send the file as a printable vehicle report to any computer on the internet to be viewed or printed easily.You don't need to be an engineer to work with Virtual Dyno. You will need to know critical information about your engine and car, but all of those figures can be found in manuals and repair guides. You will also need your cam card if you have changed cam shafts. All of the specs are a matter of looking them up in manuals that you probably already have. Virtual Dyno also comes with a database of pre-defined engines so you can just pick an engine and then make changes to match your own engine.Even if you don't build cars for a living, it's nice to know how a planned change on your favorite ride will turn out. You can also do the same for your friends, or even the competition if you can get them to brag a bit!Virtual Dyno requires a device with screen resolution of 480x320 or higher to run, and fully supports large tablets.

N\u00e5r du opretter et rejsekort i app\u00b4en, s\u00e5 g\u00e5r den ind og fremfinder alle de rejser den kan finde inde p\u00e5 rejsekort.dk. Den g\u00e5r lige s\u00e5 langt tilbage som det er muligt. Herefter vil den n\u00e5r den opdaterer altid g\u00e5 et \u00e5r tilbage. Appen opdaterer automatisk med de seneste rejser n\u00e5r den \u00e5bnes, eller du kan manuelt bede om en opdatering ved at tr\u00e6kke ned og slippe. P\u00e5 forsiden i \"Saldo\" menuen, kan du se den aktuelle saldo p\u00e5 dit rejsekort, samt de seneste 3 rejser. I \"Rejser\" menuen finder du en liste over alle de rejser som appen har registreret, Du vil derfor over tid kunne se meget langt tilbage i din rejsehistorik. I \"Rejsekort\" menuen kan du oprette et eller flere rejsekort. Fra samme konto, eller fra forskellige konti. I \"Hj\u00e6lp\" menuen kan du l\u00e6se lidt mere om hvordan app\u00b4en fungerer. N\u00e5r du vil se dine rejser, skal du v\u00e6re opm\u00e6rksom p\u00e5, at der g\u00e5r noget tid, f\u00f8r rejserne dukker op. I langt de fleste tilf\u00e6lde bliver dine rejsedata opsamlet dagligt, men der kan v\u00e6re en vis forsinkelse. Med nogle busrejser kan der g\u00e5 op til en uge, f\u00f8r data er opsamlet og registreret p\u00e5 selvbetjeningen. Det skyldes, at opsamlingen f\u00f8rst sker, i det \u00f8jeblik bussen k\u00f8rer i garage, og bussens data bliver overf\u00f8rt til rejsekortsystemet. Den korrekte saldo bliver dog gemt p\u00e5 chippen i dit rejsekort, s\u00e5 du kan altid f\u00e5 adgang til den reelle saldo p\u00e5 en rejsekortautomat eller et salgssted. Bem\u00e6rk at denne app, har ingen tilknytning til rejsekortet A/S. Den henter og viser blot dine egne oplysninger fra selvbetjening.rejsekort.dk.

Level the attitude indicator by tapping the center at any time.If desired, choose 'Use GPS for attitude' to force GPS-derived attitude indication (ignoring gyro sensors).NOTES: Sensors are optimized for use in flight, and will show dip and bank at slow speeds (eg in a car).Upon start-up, the tapes will show red X marks to indicate that no reliable GPS signal is available.  Once a reliable GPS signal has been captured, speed and altitude tapes will show.  If attitude is derived from GPS, the attitude indicator and heading tape will show once moving at a speed of greater than 10 kts.  A reliable GPS signal may not be possible indoors.The frequency of GPS updates varies considerably between devices.  The age of the last GPS fix is shown when >3s, to warn that the GPS data is old.

Like other mapping and routing applications, Ride the City finds the shortest distance between two points, with a difference. First, Ride the City avoids roads that aren't meant for biking, like highways and busy arterial streets. Second, Ride the City tries to steer cyclists toward routes that maximize the use of bike lanes, bike paths, greenways, and other bike-friendly streets while avoiding steep hills. The app includes bicycling directions for the following cities: - ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA- ATLANTA, GA- AUSTIN, TX - BARCELONA, SPAIN - BOSTON, MA - BRISBANE, QUEENSLAND - CHICAGO, IL - LOUISVILLE, KY - LYON, FRANCE- MADRID, SPAIN- MARSEILLE, FRANCE - MELBOURNE, VICTORIA- MONTREAL, QUEBEC, CANADA- NEW CASTLE, NEW SOUTH WALES - NEW YORK CITY, NY- NICE, FRANCE- PARIS, FRANCE- PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA - PORTLAND, OR - REYKJAVIK (Including all of Iceland) - SAN DIEGO, CA (Including all of San Diego County) - SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SANTIAGO, Chile - SEATTLE, WA - SEVILLA, SPAIN - SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES - TORONTO, Ontario - TOULOUSE, FRANCE- VALENCIA, SPAIN - VANCOUVER, British Columbia (including much of the surrounding area) - WASHINGTON D.C.

The app automatically defaults to the city of your location, but you can change the default to any of the other cities. * Remembers your last route: If you leave the Ride the City app for any reason and come back to it later, it will bring you to the last route you generated, just as you left it. FEATURES: * Bike shops: Ride the City displays bike shops and bike rental facilities, providing contact information and hours of operation. To find a quick bike route to a bike shop, simply touch a bike shop icon on the map and choose 'bike here'. For the nearest bike shops, just touch the 'Bike Shops' button below the map; Ride the City will display the ten bike shops closest to your current location. * Route details: When a route is generated, Ride the City displays the distance, estimated biking time, and elevation gain. It also tells you if a street along your route is a bike lane, bike path, or a caution area. * Feedback: We take your feedback very seriously. Use the 'report an error' button on the bottom left of the map to submit routing problems and suggestions, or you can email us at info@ridethecity.com. We will quickly apply your suggestions so you get a better route the next time you use Ride the City. * Updates: Get free updates as we roll out improvements and new features to make the application better.

Diese Idee haben wir Konsequent umgesetzt. Der A+ Fahrplan Leipzig Premium zeigt Ihnen stets alle Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he an!Mit dem \"Take me Home\" Knopf gelangen Sie so mit einem Knopfdruck von jeder Ecke in Leipzig (im Verkehrsnetz der LVB) sicher nach Hause. Entweder von Ihrem aktuellen Ort oder von einer Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he. Um zu einem beliebigen anderen Ziel zu fahren, ist das Konzept gleich. Ziel ausw\u00e4hlen, Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he als Abfahrt w\u00e4hlen (oder den aktuellen Ort) und los geht's. Oder klassisch mit Start und Zieleingabe.Der Fahrplan Leipzig Premium zeichnet sich durch sein durchdachtes Bedienkonzept aus, dass von Grund auf f\u00fcr Ihr Android Ger\u00e4t konzipiert wurde. Dazu z\u00e4hlt die genaue Positionserkennung mit Hilfe von GPS, das die Anzeige aller Stationen in der N\u00e4he erm\u00f6glicht. Erkennung von ortungs Ungenauigkeiten und Optimierung der Fahrplansuche f\u00fcr Mobilnetze.Die Highlights sind:- \"Take me Home\"-Knopf, um von jedem beliebigen Punkt in Leipzig und Umgebung mit einem Knopfdruck nach Hause zu fahren.- Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he werden metergenau angezeigt und beim Gehen aktualisiert - und das sogar ohne eine Netzverbindung!- Abfahrtsmonitor: Zeigt alle Fahrten von einer Haltestelle an- \u00dcbersichtliche Darstellung und Auswahl der Abfahrts- und Ankunfts-Haltestelle in auf der Karte.- Beliebige Ziele (Haltestellen, Stra\u00dfen, etc.) in Leipzig und Umgebung k\u00f6nnen angefahren werden. Die Anwendung merkt sich bereits gesuchte Ziele, so dass diese nur ein einziges Mal eingetippt werden m\u00fcssen. Die n\u00e4chste Zieleingabe ist dann nur ein Knopfdruck!- Ein Grundkonzept der Anwendung ist, dass ihr Ger\u00e4t ihren Standort kennt. Dadurch entf\u00e4llt in der Regel die Eingabe der Abfahrtortes. Alle zu Fu\u00df erreichbaren Haltestellen werden als m\u00f6glicher Abfahrtsort direkt angezeigt. Nur bei schlechtem GPS Empfang werden Sie gebeten den Abfahrtsort selbst einzugeben.- Ergebnisse werden sehr kompakt und \u00fcbersichtlich angezeigt.- Netzplan mit allen Verkehrsmitteln (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram und Bus)  wird auf der Karte Dargestellt. Fu\u00dfwege werden auf der Karte angezeigt.- Auswahl der Verkehrsmittel die man verwenden m\u00f6chte (z.B. k\u00f6nnen Busse abgew\u00e4hlt werden)- Ein Abfahrtsmonitor zeigt alle Fahrten von einer Haltestelle anHINWEISZur Verwendung der Fahrplanauskunft wird eine aktive Onlineverbindung ben\u00f6tigt, da die Daten vom Auskunftssystem geladen werden.

This idea we implemented consistently. The A + Timetable Leipzig Premium you always displays all the stops to close!With the \"Take me Home\" button which takes you to a push of a button from any corner in Leipzig (in the transport network of the LVB) home safely. Either from your current location or by a station nearby. To travel to any other destination, the concept is the same. Select destination station nearby as exit select (or the current location) and off you go. Or classic with start and finish input.The roadmap Leipzig Premium is characterized by its sophisticated user interface that was designed from the ground up device for your android. These include the precise position detection with the help of GPS, which allows the display of all stations nearby. Recognition of positioning inaccuracies and optimization of the timetable search for mobile networks.The highlights are:- \"Take me Home\" button to go from any point in and around Leipzig with a push of a button home.- Stops in the vicinity are displayed meter accuracy and updated during walking - even without a network connection!- Exit Monitor: Displays all drives from a stop to- Clear presentation and selection of the departure and arrival stop in on the map.- Arbitrary destinations (stations, roads, etc.) in and around Leipzig can be approached. The application remembers already searched goals so that they must be typed only once. The next destination input is then just a push of a button!- A basic concept of the application is that their device knows its location. This eliminates typically the entry of the departure point. All stops within walking distance, are displayed directly as a possible departure point. Only with poor GPS reception, you will be asked to enter the place of departure itself.- Results appear very compact and clear.- Network with all means of transport (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses) is Shown on the map. Footpaths are shown on the map.- Selection of the transport you want to use (for example, buses can be deselected)- A departure board shows all the rides from one station toNOTETo use the timetable information an active online connection is required, since the data is loaded from the information system.

{"title": "Flight Map", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Makro+Productions", "rating": "3.359999895095825", "Description": " YOU CAN DO IT ON A PLANE!Flight Map is a unique application that works as your own personal flight tracker (Sky map) while flying in an airplane. It shows where you currently are, speed, altitude and some other information about your flight. You can check the Estimated Time of Arrival of your flight while you are sitting on a plane. You can see how far from the target airport you are. You can also see and name the landmarks on the way, so that you know what you see from your window.There are two more version of Flight Map - Flight Map FREE which you can try for free and see if it works on your device without some functionality and Flight Map HD which includes more detailed world map, but it comes at a price of consuming more space in your phone's memory.Flight Map also displays visible and used GPS / GLONASS satellites, so you can use it as a GPS testing tool. The GPS function works when your phone is in airplane mode, because it does not broadcast any radio, it rather listens to the GPS satellites only.Features include:- Real time position of the plane on the map- Zoomable world map not dependent on a connection to internet- Your own personal flight tracker- Works when your phone is in Airplane mode, so it can be used anytime while in flight- Recording your route and sharing it on the internet- Database of world airports- Entering destination as longitude / latitude coordinates- Estimated Time to Destination and Time to Arrival depending on the plane type and position- Dark / Light skin- Metric / Imperial units- Multilanguage (currently English, Spanish, Portugese, French, Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Czech, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Hungarian)- Map can be fullscreen or split screen with real time flight data- GPS / GLONASS Satellites real time display depending on your device capabilities- Sunrise and sunset at present position- Line to destination can be shown or hidden- Altitude calculation calibrated either to sea level or destination altitudePlease note that Flight Map is heavily dependent on the quality of your device's GPS capabilities. If your device is capable of A-GPS (Assisted GPS), please run the application while on the ground, so that the satellites' positions get downloaded from the internet, it will be much easier for the device to pick up signal when in the air. Please share your experience with various devices. Most of the time Flight Map works perfectly when sitting in a window seat and does not work too good when sitting two seats from the window or more. In any case we recommend to move the device to the window, let it pick up the satellites signal first and then try how far from the window it can pick up the signal. The screen showing the visible and used satellites is designed to help you with this.If your device is capable of receiving GLONASS signal, the satellites are shown with a differently colored border. If you want to translate Flight Map into your language (or correct our translation), please contact the developer. The first run of the application takes a while because it needs to unpack the whole world map to be able to display it.Polish translation thanks to Tomasz PrycaHungarian translation thanks to Dr. Istvan Lunczer  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=marko.android.flightmap", "price": "EGP7.00", "date_published": "May 4, 2014", "email": "makro.productions@haulis.com", "downloads": "500 - 1,000", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Makro Productions", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "3.0 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.haulis.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFucNh0hVVGWedXE8vRnVOhs_GqyA", "reviewers": "25"}

{"title": "Vibrations!", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=jjbunn", "rating": "5", "Description": " Vibrations is an app for measuring mechanical vibrations and acoustic noise from engines, the environment, machines, and other equipment.This is (currently) the only app that combines acoustic *and* mechanical measurements!Uses: monitoring vehicle engine vibration, monitoring vibrations of household appliances (dishwasher, refrigerator, waste disposal units, clothes dryers, etc.), measuring g-force in moving vehicles, helping to identify failing gears, evidenced by knocking sounds, modes, etc..Vibrations uses data streams from the built-in accelerometer and microphone: it calculates two simultaneous FFTs, one from the mechanical measurements, one from the audible measurements. It then shows the frequency spectra on the screen. The frequency axis is labelled in Hz and RPM (revolutions per minute).Four on-screen software gauges give an overview of the measurements:1) The g-force (excluding gravity), which measures acceleration2) The frequency of the current peak in the mechanical/vibration noise3) The frequency of the current peak in the acoustic noise4) The sample rate at which mechanical vibrations are being measuredScreen shots can be taken using the \"Save Screen\" button, and stored to the SD card.Time series of accelerometer data (up to 20 seconds) can be recorded and saved using the \"Record Data\" button. Since data are continually being gathered, the recorded data written to the file actually starts a second or so *before* the button was pressed. Recording can be interrupted while in progress, and the data discarded or saved. Otherwise, the recording will automatically terminate after 20 seconds have elapsed, and the data discarded or saved then.Data collection can be paused and resumed using the \"Pause\"/\"Resume\" button.This is the first release of this app, and ideas for improvements/enhancements are welcome: please contact me. Also, please note that the frequency limit of the mechanical vibration measurement is limited by the maximum rate that accelerometer samples can be obtained from the Android device: this typically varies from device to device - e.g. on the Nexus 7 and 10 tablets, the rate is ~200 samples/sec, giving a maximum frequency measurement of ~100Hz or 6000 RPM. On the Galaxy S3 the rate is ~100 samples/sec, giving a maximum frequency of ~50Hz.

{"title": "ALDLdroid", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=S%C3%A9bastien+Giroux", "rating": "4.809523582458496", "Description": " ALDLdroid is an application for OBD1 GM (ALDL) ECMs. It is currently compatible with both 160 baud and 8192 baud protocols.It is compatible with TunerPro files (ADX), just make sure you have the ADX file matching your ECM code mask before purchasing the app. You will also need to make sure your ADX file is NOT encrypted as the app cannot read those. You will have to copy your ADX file to the ADX directory of the ALDLdroid folder on the SD card once you've started the app for the first time and the folders structure has been created. Verify that your Android device has external storage capability (most likely SD card). There is also a tuning section that uses TunerPro files as well (XDF) to allow editing BIN files. Real-time tuning is currently supported. I got very little feedback on it tho so there might be a few issues here and there. Otherwise it does supports the Ostrich and possibly the AutoProm as well. Chip programming is also possible using the Moates BURN1/BURN2 hardware.Currently, connection to the ECM can be made with Bluetooth or USB (FTDI). Make sure that your Android device support one of these two connection methods. USB host mode is only available on Android 3.0+ and not all devices support it. Note that having a USB port on your Android device doesn't automatically means it support USB host mode.ALDL adapters to connect the application to your vehicule ECM can be purchased here if you don't already have one:- Bluetooth version: http://www.reddevilriver.com/ALDL_Bluetooth.php- USB version: http://www.reddevilriver.com/aldl.htmlBy double tapping on any page of the dashboard, you enter the dashboard edit mode. That mode allow full customization (add/edit/delete) of the dashboard indicators. You can easily drag indicators where you want them. You can also add indicators in the format you want: gauge, basic readout, bar graph or histogram. Alarm can be set once your specified value has been entered to trigger an alarm, either the indicator can turn red and/or the Android app can vibrate.No refund can be made after the 15 minutes allowed by Google Play. It would probably be a good idea to check with online communities that use the same ECM as you if they had success with this app before purchasing.If you're running into any issue with the app, don't panic, just email me and I will try my best to help. Don't leave a bad review until you gave me a chance to help :) Note that I might not have access to your exact setup (Car ECM, Android device, etc) so please provide as much information as possible.I'm not responsible for any damage that could be caused by this app to your vehicle or anything else (although I really don't see how anything bad could happen). Buy and use at your own risks. Drive safe!

This speedometer software features a retro design and has a warning chime function for over speeding. It sounds an alarm chime* when the vehicle exceeds the set speed limit.*The application software is named after the \"dingdong\" alarm sound (sounds like \"kin-kon\" or \"king-kong\" when expressed in Japanese).\u2501\u2501 What is the speed warning chime? \u2501\u2501It was mandatory for all Japanese vehicles to be equipped with speed alarms between 1974 and 1986. Reminding you of the chime sounds of those days, this speed alarm is used to make you pay attention to the vehicle\u2019s speed when you exceed a certain limit (ordinary passenger car: approx. 100 km/h, light car: approx. 80km/h).\u2501\u2501 Target users \u2501\u2501\u2605Persons who want to be aware of the moving speed and distance while driving/riding a car, bus, train, or bicycle and jogging or walking.\u2605Persons who want to control the moving speed.\u2605Persons who long for the nostalgic \u201cdingdong\u201d speed alarm sounds of the Japanese cars of 1974 to 1986.\u2501\u2501 Features \u2501\u2501\u2605Speedometer When the Android device receives Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signals, the speedometer displays your current speed. You can use the lower right switch to change the display unit between \"km/h\" and \"MPH.\"The meter can display speeds between 0 and 180km/h (MPH).There is an additional function (provided at a charge) that allows you to set the highest speed from four selections (60, 180, 240, and 360).The left side indicator (satellite icon) among the indicators under the meter informs you of the receiving status of GPS satellite signals. The indicator lights red when you are in a place such as a building or tunnel that blocks reception of GPS satellite signals. It turns green when GPS satellite signals can be received properly. \u2605Speed warning chime When you exceed the set speed limit, the speed warning indicator under the screen lights red and the application sounds a \u201cdingdong\u201d speed warning chime at the same time.You can change the setting speed by tapping the Setting button and moving the red needle displayed on the screen with your finger. The speed-warning chime may sound slightly off-tempo sometimes because this speedometer attempts to reproduce the feel of the 70s and 80s chimes. This is not a bug. This application software does not have a volume adjustment function. Use the volume control on the Android device to adjust the sound.\u2605Travelling distanceThe meter displays the distance that has been traveled while this application software is turned on. The distance is measured in kilometers (or miles).The upper display shows the odometer. This value cumulates until you uninstall the application software.The lower display shows the trip meter. This value is reset when you tap the Reset button. \u2605Warning lamp (rightmost lamp)When a \"certain condition\" is met, the rightmost indicator under the meter lights. \u3010Warning and cautions\u3011\u25a0Never operate this application software while you are driving a car.\u25a0If the alarm chime makes you drowsy, stop using the alarm immediately.\u25a0Be sure to use this application software when you are outside. Otherwise, it may not display the accurate speed and distance.\u25a0This application software uses the Location Service, therefore turn ON the Location Service when you use it.

One downside of GPS is that a) sometimes it's unreliable and b) it may take a while to get an accurate fix. If you're having a hard time getting a signal (i.e. you're in a parking garage or blocked by tall buildings or trees), try moving around until you have a clear view of the sky. Also keep in mind that the GPS chipset built into older phones is not as reliable/fast as newer chipsets so this app is ultimately limited by the hardware in your phone.Please keep these considerations in mind when using the app or leaving a review!

The gear ratio of our rides remains the same as long as there is no shift of gears. This way, the speed can be calculated from the rpm just as you can then calculate the performance by the change of speed which equals acceleration. To obtain the most realistic performance value possible, you need to enter a couple of values as precisely as possible:- overall weight- tire circumference- air pressure- temperature- gear ratio - Cw-Value (Tough one, but if you don't change this for different runs, you get repeatable and combarable results, this value moves the resulting curve on the y-axis, so it can be used to calibrate the dyno. If this value is way off the result can be off about 2 PS)If you know the Windows programs SIP Dyno and GSF Dyno, you know how exact these measurements are.You can find a couple of comparisons between GSF Dyno, this App and a real dyno (P4) at www.siphorsepowerdyno.de and in the Scootering from January 2013.Requirements:- This App only works if there is no shift in gears.

The response from your OBD2 adapter will display on the screen. Tap the send button without typing in a new code, and the last code will be sent to the unit again. If you send codes in rapid succession and the returned message gets garbled or split, your adapter is too slow to keep up with most of the dashboard type apps, meaning it can't keep up wit the real-time data need.We suggest you review a good source of OBD2 PID codes before using this app because the data you send is not filtered. This means that you can send codes which will clear or reset your vehicle's diagnostic data. You can use this app to read and reset trouble codes as well.

A Nearest Airport navigation function backs you up in case of emergency.InFlight has three main views:1) Primary Flight Display with gyro-based attitude indicator with slip and rate-of-turn indicators, speed, altitude and heading tapes, and nearby airport information. If nearby terrain or obstacles are within 1000ft of your aircraft, a pop-up terrain/obstacle map will appear on this screen. Heading tape shows track and bearing lines for navigation2) Moving map with airports, navaids, terrain and obstacles, and full Flight Plan navigation. Airports are color-coded for gliding range.  Terrain shows elevation shading and yellow/red warnings. Map has zoom and pan functionality, and can show track up or North up3) List of nearby airports, with color coding to determine which ones are within gliding range. Airport information includes distance, bearing, and length of longest runwayFor devices without gyro sensors, attitude is derived from GPS.InFlight requires purchase of a regional database once every 3 months for about $3, to maintain current terrain/obstacle/airport information. The database expires every first day of the quarter and a new one is available 10 days before the end of the quarter.We offer databases for North America, Europe (includes all of Turkey), Asia, Oceania (Australia & New Zealand) and South America. Elevation and airport data is available everywhere. Obstacle information is currently only available for North America.Continuous Adaptive Auto-Calibration adjusts the gyro for sensor drift as a result of temperature, engine vibration and sensor errors.  A Kalman filter combines input from multiple sensors for better attitude stability.  When starting the app for the first time, leave it at rest for at least one minute to allow for calibration.For correct indication, the device needs to be placed vertical, with the screen facing the pilot, but aligned with the axis of flight (i.e., not rotated for better viewing). Level the attitude indicator by tapping the center at any time.If desired, choose 'Use GPS for attitude' to force GPS-derived attitude indication (ignoring gyro sensors).NOTES: Sensors are optimized for use in flight, and will show dip and bank at slow speeds (eg in a car).Upon start-up, the tapes will show red X marks to indicate that no reliable GPS signal is available.  Once a reliable GPS signal has been captured, speed and altitude tapes will show.  If attitude is derived from GPS, the attitude indicator and heading tape will show once moving at a speed of greater than 10 kts.  A reliable GPS signal may not be possible indoors.The frequency of GPS updates varies considerably between devices.  The age of the last GPS fix is shown when >3s, to warn that the GPS data is old.  All indications are not reliable when the GPS data is old.Data is derived from GPS, and therefore only an approximation of actual air speed, altitude and heading (and attitude for devices without gyro sensors).  Do not use for primary navigation or attitude reference.  You assume total responsibility and risk associated with this application.Most devices have accelerometer sensors, but this is not the same as gyro sensors.  Gyro attitude is only possible with gyro sensors, so please check your device documentation to confirm you have gyro sensors.  If not, InFlight will derive attitude information from the GPS, which is still very useful in flight, but not as smooth and accurate as gyro indication.DISCLAIMER: This app is not FAA approved and should not be used for primary navigation.

Diese Idee haben wir Konsequent umgesetzt. Der A+ Fahrplan N\u00fcrnberg Premium zeigt Ihnen stets alle Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he an!Mit dem \"Take me Home\" Knopf gelangen Sie so mit einem Knopfdruck von jeder Ecke in N\u00fcrnberg (im Verkehrsnetz des VGN) sicher nach Hause. Entweder von Ihrem aktuellen Ort oder von einer Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he. Um zu einem beliebigen anderen Ziel zu fahren, ist das Konzept gleich. Ziel ausw\u00e4hlen, Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he als Abfahrt w\u00e4hlen (oder den aktuellen Ort) und los geht's. Oder klassisch mit Start und Zieleingabe.Der Fahrplan N\u00fcrnberg Premium zeichnet sich durch sein durchdachtes Bedienkonzept aus, dass von Grund auf f\u00fcr Ihr Android Ger\u00e4t konzipiert wurde. Dazu z\u00e4hlt die genaue Positionserkennung mit Hilfe von GPS, das die Anzeige aller Stationen in der N\u00e4he erm\u00f6glicht. Erkennung von ortungs Ungenauigkeiten und Optimierung der Fahrplansuche f\u00fcr Mobilnetze.Die Highlights sind:- \"Take me Home\"-Knopf, um von jedem beliebigen Punkt in N\u00fcrnberg und Umgebung mit einem Knopfdruck nach Hause zu fahren.- Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he werden metergenau angezeigt und beim Gehen aktualisiert - und das sogar ohne eine Netzverbindung!- Abfahrtsmonitor: Zeigt alle Fahrten von einer Haltestelle an- \u00dcbersichtliche Darstellung und Auswahl der Abfahrts- und Ankunfts-Haltestelle in auf der Karte.- Beliebige Ziele (Haltestellen, Stra\u00dfen, etc.) in N\u00fcrnberg und Umgebung k\u00f6nnen angefahren werden. Die Anwendung merkt sich bereits gesuchte Ziele, so dass diese nur ein einziges Mal eingetippt werden m\u00fcssen. Die n\u00e4chste Zieleingabe ist dann nur ein Knopfdruck!- Ein Grundkonzept der Anwendung ist, dass ihr Ger\u00e4t ihren Standort kennt. Dadurch entf\u00e4llt in der Regel die Eingabe der Abfahrtortes. Alle zu Fu\u00df erreichbaren Haltestellen werden als m\u00f6glicher Abfahrtsort direkt angezeigt. Nur bei schlechtem GPS Empfang werden Sie gebeten den Abfahrtsort selbst einzugeben.- Ergebnisse werden sehr kompakt und \u00fcbersichtlich angezeigt.- Netzplan mit allen Verkehrsmitteln (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram und Bus)  wird auf der Karte Dargestellt. Fu\u00dfwege werden auf der Karte angezeigt.- Auswahl der Verkehrsmittel die man verwenden m\u00f6chte (z.B. k\u00f6nnen Busse abgew\u00e4hlt werden)- Ein Abfahrtsmonitor zeigt alle Fahrten von einer Haltestelle anHINWEISZur Verwendung der Fahrplanauskunft wird eine aktive Onlineverbindung ben\u00f6tigt, da die Daten vom Auskunftssystem geladen werden.

This idea we implemented consistently. The A + Timetable Nuremberg Premium you always displays all the stops to close!With the \"Take me Home\" button which takes you to a push of a button from any corner in N\u00fcrnberg (in the transport network of the VGN) home safely. Either from your current location or by a station nearby. To travel to any other destination, the concept is the same. Select destination station nearby as exit select (or the current location) and off you go. Or classic with start and finish input.The roadmap Nuremberg Premium is characterized by its sophisticated user interface that was designed from the ground up device for your android. These include the precise position detection with the help of GPS, which allows the display of all stations nearby. Recognition of positioning inaccuracies and optimization of the timetable search for mobile networks.The highlights are:- \"Take me Home\" button to go from any point in Nuremberg and surroundings with a touch of a button home.- Stops in the vicinity are displayed meter accuracy and updated during walking - even without a network connection!- Exit Monitor: Displays all drives from a stop to- Clear presentation and selection of the departure and arrival stop in on the map.- Arbitrary destinations (stations, roads, etc.) in Nuremberg and the surrounding area can be approached. The application remembers already searched goals so that they must be typed only once. The next destination input is then just a push of a button!- A basic concept of the application is that their device knows its location. This eliminates typically the entry of the departure point. All stops within walking distance, are displayed directly as a possible departure point. Only with poor GPS reception, you will be asked to enter the place of departure itself.- Results appear very compact and clear.- Network with all means of transport (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses) is Shown on the map. Footpaths are shown on the map.- Selection of the transport you want to use (for example, buses can be deselected)- A departure board shows all the rides from one station toNOTETo use the timetable information an active online connection is required, since the data is loaded from the information system.

Durch diese Medizinisch-Psychologische Untersuchung (oder Fahreignungsbegutachtung) sollen Sie nachweisen, dass trotz Ihrer eingetragenen Verst\u00f6\u00dfe keine erhebliche Wiederholungsgefahr mehr besteht. Eine solche \u201epositive Eignungsprognose\u201c gibt es aber nicht ohne Arbeit: Sie m\u00fcssen sich gut vorbereiten. Mit diesem MPU-Vorbereitungsprogramm k\u00f6nnen Sie sich gezielt auf die Fragen der Gutachter einstellen und sich selbst \u201ecoachen.\u201c Je nach Anlass der MPU finden Sie Erkl\u00e4rungen und Hilfen aus der Praxis der Begutachtung f\u00fcr ein erfolgreiches Bestehen der Pr\u00fcfung. Die Autoren dieses Programms haben ihre Erfahrung mit mehreren tausend MPU-Klienten in kompakter Form zusammengestellt, damit Sie die Gutachter von sich \u00fcberzeugen k\u00f6nnen, zumindest aber die gr\u00f6bsten Fehler bei der Begutachtung vermeiden. Doch Vorsicht: \u201eBestehens-Garantien\u201c gibt es keine. Der Erfolg in der MPU h\u00e4ngt vor allem von Ihrer eigenen Bereitschaft zur Einsicht und Verhaltens\u00e4nderung ab.

Der Erfolg entscheidet sich nicht in der MPU, sondern davor. Darum machen Sie bitte vor der Arbeit mit dem Programm den T\u00dcV-Check f\u00fcr den Idiotentest und nach Beendigung des Programms noch einmal. Dann sollte sich einiges in Ihrem Kopf bewegt haben.

Such a \"positive prognosis suitability\" there is not no work: you have to prepare well. This MPU-preparation program, you can set specifically on the questions of the experts themselves and \"coach.\" Depending on the occasion of the MPU find explanations and help from the practice of peer review to successfully pass the exam. The authors of this program have compiled their experience with thousands of clients MPU in a compact form, so that you can convince the verifier of itself, but at least avoid the worst mistakes in the assessment. But beware: \"existence guarantees\" there are none. The success in the MPU depends primarily on your own willingness to review and change their behavior. This program is the guide to everything and if you have worked through systematically, you will understand that the key to success is your basic attitude to MPU. The success is not decided in the MPU, but before that. So please make prior to working with the program to TUV check for the idiot test and after completing the program again.

{"title": "Flight Map HD", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Makro+Productions", "rating": "5", "Description": " YOU CAN DO IT ON A PLANE!Flight Map HD is a unique application that works as your own personal flight tracker (Sky map) while flying in an airplane. It shows where you currently are, speed, altitude and some other information about your flight. You can check the Estimated Time of Arrival of your flight while you are sitting on a plane. You can see how far from the target airport you are. You can also see and name the landmarks on the way, so that you know what you see from your window.This is an HD version of everyone's favorite Flight Map. Due to popular demand there are two more map zoom levels included, so that more detail is visible while flying. Please beware that due to the world being really big, you need 1 GB of space on your device to download and unpack the map in this HD version. When running Flight Map HD for the first time please be patient, it has to unpack thousands of map tiles into a directory structure, so it takes several minutes even on the fastest of devices.Flight Map HD also displays visible and used GPS / GLONASS satellites, so you can use it as a GPS testing tool. The GPS function works when your phone is in airplane mode, because it does not broadcast any radio, it rather listens to the GPS satellites only.Features include:- Real time position of the plane on the map- Zoomable world map not dependent on a connection to internet- Your own personal flight tracker- Works when your phone is in Airplane mode, so it can be used anytime while in flight- Recording your route and sharing it on the internet- Database of world airports- Entering destination as longitude / latitude coordinates- Estimated Time to Destination and Time to Arrival depending on the plane type and position- Dark / Light skin- Metric / Imperial units- Multilanguage (currently English, Spanish, Portugese, French, Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Czech, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Hungarian)- Map can be fullscreen or split screen with real time flight data- GPS / GLONASS Satellites real time display depending on your device capabilities- Sunrise and sunset at present position- Line to destination can be shown or hidden- Altitude calculation calibrated either to sea level or destination altitudePlease note that Flight Map HD is heavily dependent on the quality of your device's GPS capabilities. If your device is capable of A-GPS (Assisted GPS), please run the application while on the ground, so that the satellites' positions get downloaded from the internet, it will be much easier for the device to pick up signal when in the air. Please share your experience with various devices. Most of the time Flight Map HD works perfectly when sitting in a window seat and does not work too good when sitting two seats from the window or more. In any case we recommend to move the device to the window, let it pick up the satellites signal first and then try how far from the window it can pick up the signal. The screen showing the visible and used satellites is designed to help you with this.If your device is capable of receiving GLONASS signal, the satellites are shown with a differently colored border. If you want to translate Flight Map into your language (or correct our translation), please contact the developer. The first run of the application takes a while because it needs to unpack the whole world map to be able to display it.Polish translation thanks to Tomasz PrycaHungarian translation thanks to Dr. Istvan Lunczer  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=marko.android.flightmapHD", "price": "EGP21.15", "date_published": "August 7, 2014", "email": "makro.productions@haulis.com", "downloads": "50 - 100", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Makro Productions", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "3.0 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.haulis.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFucNh0hVVGWedXE8vRnVOhs_GqyA", "reviewers": "1"}

AISView is designed to receive and display wireless NMEA data from any of Digital Yacht\u2019s NMEA to Wifi devices like the WLN10, NavLink, iNavHub or iAIS. Although a \"wire free\" connection is the easiest way to get data in to the tablet, if you do not have one of our wireless NMEA products, you can also connect using Digital Yacht\u2019s USB-NMEA adaptor. Connect this cable to the NMEA0183 output of your AIS and plug the USB connector in to a suitable USB OTG cable for your tablet and you have a simple and cost effective method of getting AIS data in to the tabletEven if you have a full featured AIS display on your main plotter, having an extra display on a tablet is useful as a repeater or 2nd display. Utilising the internal GPS of the Android tablet, you will also have a completely separate backup system, which should your main plotter fail, will display your position, all of the AIS targets around you and also provide anti-collision alarms with CPA and TCPA calculations.Once installed, you\u2019ll see an overlay of AIS target information onto a background Google map.  Tap on a target and you\u2019ll get a drop down list with identity, heading and closest point of approach (CPA) information.  A heading vector makes it easy to see potential collision course targets.  Google maps can now be cached if you don\u2019t have an internet connection but even if this feature is not used, AISView will present an attractive radar like visualisation with range rings overlaying the targets around your vessel.AISView also supports a simple bearing and distance ruler, compass heading display and current position and track history from the device\u2019s built in GPS.  Alarms can be configured for closest point of approach and AIS SARTs \u2013 useful for MOB applications.  If you have a live internet connection, you can also supplement the real time overlay with AIS information obtained from the popular BoatBeacon internet AIS app (if this is installed) allowing you to view AIS targets in remote ports or locations.Requirements:Android Smartphone or Tablet with GPS. A wireless NMEA (TCP or UDP) AIS data connection or a compatible USB to NMEA adaptor cable and OTG USB Cable.Important Notes:-  Please note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.-  This program should only be used as an aid to navigation.

{"title": "OBD-2 Mode-06 Translator", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=ADPTraining", "rating": "3.6666667461395264", "Description": " OBD-2 Mode 06 Translator APP(Note: This APP runs fine on Android phones and tablets. This APP is a companion to any OBD-2 scanner. This APP decodes Mode-06 on CAN systems, Some 2003-2006 and all 2007-Up models (any make and model sold in the US.)HOW TO USE THE OBD2 MODE-06 TRANSLATOR APPMode 06 on OBD-2 systems was created to allow engineers to see if a particular system was failing before the monitors had ran. Monitors are small tests that OBD-2 runs on each system (EGR, O2 sensor, Converter, etc) to see if the system is failing. It takes a long time for these tests/monitors to run, sometimes hours or even days. So the power of mode 06 is to allow for quick diagnostics and proofing of your repair.Here are the highlights of mode 06 and why it's so popular:1) Allows you to see if your repair was done right almost right away.2) After the repair is done, go for a short road test (that's all).3) Use an inexpensive scan tool to view mode 06. Most scanners have this feature.4) Mode 06 allows you to view dozens of ECM tests results right away.5) Mode 06 was developed as an encrypted ($hex) coded diagnostic system.6) Mode 06 was never meant for the masses, unless it is translated.Here is how to use the OBD-2 Mode 06 Translator APP. There are two ways to use Mode-06 with this APP.ONE: Is to look at your scanner's capabilities and see if it gives you PASS/FAIL results for Mode-06. If it does then you're halfway there. That means that the scan tool did 50% of the work for you. With a PASS/FAIL type scanner, the unit has already looked at the Min. and Max. values, saw the Current value and made a determination as to the test result.TWO: Is to determine the test Min. and Max. values (Given by this APP) and compare them to the Current value. This type of scanner is usually seen as a USB-Interface PC based scanner (i.e. ELM327 type). It is also used by someone accessing the deep ($hex) hexadecimal numbers given by the ECM OBD-2 connector. So if your scanner is PASS/FAIL then great, disregard the (Current Value) translator section. Just concentrate on the MIDs and TIDs pull-down buttons. They'll translate the MODE-06 data for you and then all you do is look at the PASS/FAIL score. If your scanner outputs the $Hex numbers, then all you do is compare them to the Min. and Max. values given by this APP. To use this APP after repairs are done (or during repairs), go for a short road test to allow the ECM to run the mode 06 test it normally does. On some repairs that don't require for you to drive the car (i.e. O2 Sensor Heater) then a road test is not needed. Just start your vehicle and wait at least 10 minutes with the engine at idle. Than do your magic with this (OBD-2 Mode 06 Translator APP).This is the first APP of it's kind anywhere made possible by Android technology. If in doubt you can always e-mail us with any questions. I assure you they will be answered. This OBD-2 Mode-06 Translator APP is an offshoot technology of the OBD-2 Scan-1 Diagnostic System, developed by the author, Mandy Concepcion.Authored by Mandy Concepcion  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_lotus07305.OBD2Mode06Decoder", "price": "EGP41.69", "date_published": "December 7, 2011", "email": "technician@autodiagnosticsandpublishing.com", "downloads": "100 - 500", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "ADPTraining", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.0 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.autodiagnosticsandpublishing.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHtqrqvilYGrg5jTAdDJEP7o4CfvQ", "reviewers": "3"}

{"title": "InertialNav", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=JTO", "rating": "3", "Description": " InertialNav App is a toolbox for inertial navigation. It uses information from sensors (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and GPS), when available, to derive attitude, position and velocity information.Recent methods are used in InertialNav App to provide reliable and robust attitude estimation. InertialNav App can provide an attitude estimation that is, in average, unbiaised by local accelerations, taking the most from low-grade sensors generally available in handset and tablets.It includes the following instruments: \u2714 artificial horizon / gyro attitude indicator, \u2714 altimeter, \u2714 3D compass (gyro, magnetic) that works in every orientations, \u2714 speed meter (ground speed, vertical speed), \u2714 ground track.An optimal filter is used to estimate as accurately as possible attitude and position of the device. Bear in mind, though, that phones usually have low-quality sensors.In addition: \u2714 A HUD mode allows using the application for augmented reality.  \u2714 You can display a Google Map for your position, \u2714 You can monitor the sensors in your Android device, \u2714 You can store real-time measurements and estimations into GPX file (GPS measures only), text files or, send these measurement over a wifi internal network with UDP, for post-processing (e.g. into MATLAB, SciLab, LabView, ...). \u2714 complete set of options allow you to fine tune the apps to your particular needs. If a feature is missing, do not hesitate to ask!HOW DOES IT WORK?In real life environment, sensors tend to measure noises in addition to the physical quantity of interest. The current application provides an estimate of the attitude. To have the best estimation of the attitude an data fusion (EKF, UKF) is used. The filter purpose is to reject all perturbations, but to do so efficiently, it needs different sources of measurments. Considering we are interested by the orientation, and your device is indeed an inertial measurement unit (IMU with gyroscopes, accelerometers and so on), using gyroscopes for angular velocity and a set of measurements from accelerometers and magnetometers, InertialNav can indeed estimate the attitude with the filter. That is, to estimate the attitude, InertialNav will sometimes discard information from the sensors that it deems unreliable or too noisy - it may sometimes favour the attitude measurements rather than the angular velocity integration and vice versa - to minimise the covariance of the error. Furthermore, quaternion formulation for the orientation makes the estimation very robust.Additionally, if GPS is available, sub-meter positioning can be obtained. That is, this can not work efficiently indoors (drift in position and velocity).** IMPORTANT ** : depending on your device, please consider going through the covariance settings for best estimation of the attitude! InertialNav may disregard the measurements if deemed unreliable. If YOU THINK the app does not use the gyroscopes, please CHECK the variance settings for the gyroscopes. OUTPUTSData can be saved as a text file on the SD card.Data can also be send over UDP local wifi network. Data are send as float (4 bytes, Little endian), as following:[time, Measured Acceleration {X, Y, Z}, Measured Orientation {Pitch, Roll, Yaw}, Magnetic Field {X, Y, Z}, Pitch Estimate, Roll Estimate, Yaw Estimate]MINIMUM REQUIREMENTSMinimum requirements: accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers.Optional requirements: GPS, camera.   - Groundtrack mode will only be available when GPS is enabled,  - HeadUp Display will only be available when a camera is available,  - Multiple panels only available for 7\" and above screen size.The application is provided as-is, without any warranty.

Simply snap a picture of the vehicle registration plate and our ANPR/ALPR (automated number plate/license plate recognition) will quickly and accurately recognise and transcribe the registration code for you. You can then add details about each vehicle (such as name of owner or make/model) to a list. The next time you encounter that vehicle, CarCheck will recognise it and display all the details.The list of vehicles and associated details can be displayed, sorted in different ways, modified, and exported to other applications using the standard CSV (comma separated value) file format. Unlike other scanning apps, this one runs entirely on your Android device without needing a network, so there are NO data charges or network delays whatsoever, and the number plates and images you take do NOT have to be uploaded to any server.As well as handling poor and low lighting conditions, CarCheck also supports numerous formats of car, motorcycle, and heavy goods vehicle plates, including personalised and some international (non-UK) number plates.Limitations:CarCheck supports up to 150 vehicles in the database at any time. This version is optimised for UK vehicle registration plates, please contact us for information on other locales.Customers who require more advanced recognition or integration capabilities may wish to upgrade to one of our other ANPR and parking enforcement solutions. To enquire about professional deployment, volume licensing deals, international plate formats and other options, or to hear about the wide range of other image recognition solutions offered by Imense Ltd., please email sales@imense.com and visit our website.Usage:(1) Hold your Android device horizontally, making sure the camera is not obscured. Try to line up the vehicle number plate such that it falls roughly within the green focusing rectangle.(2) Tap the camera icon on the screen to take a picture of the number plate. CarCheck will analyse the image you took and recognise and display the registration code. The registration string will be displayed in green (high confidence), amber (medium confidence), or red (low confidence). You can simply hit 'return' to take the image again. There is also a button and settings option to make use of the flash or torch light (only effective at short distances).(3) If the vehicle is already in your database, then details are displayed. Otherwise simply click the 'Add to list' button to add details about a vehicle and add it to the database.(4) To take a new image, simply press the 'back' button on your Android device.(5) The name of the database CSV file can be configured via the 'Settings' menu. The file is stored on your SD card. To display or edit the list, tap the 'Lists...' button or choose 'Manage Lists'.

Most visitors come to Corsica in the summer months, and particularly in August.There are four airports on the island: Ajaccio, Bastia, Calvi and Figari (next to Porto-Vecchio). It's advisable to rent a car when in Corsica, as the public transport is very poor. There are only 3 train lines connecting the major cities, the rest is by bus - which at most leaves twice a day!Corsica has many walking trails, including the GR 20, perhaps the best known and most difficult of all the Grande Randonn\u00e9e trails. Corsica has excellent beaches. Beside sunbathing and swimming almost every beach offers opportunities to snorkel. Some more popular beaches will rent windsurf boards and kite-surfing boards. Scuba diving is available, particularly at popular beaches near islands and in major towns.

Entweder von Ihrem aktuellen Ort oder von einer Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he. Um zu einem beliebigen anderen Ziel zu fahren, ist das Konzept gleich. Ziel ausw\u00e4hlen, Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he als Abfahrt w\u00e4hlen (oder den aktuellen Ort) und los geht's. Oder klassisch mit Start und Zieleingabe.Der Fahrplan Bremen Premium zeichnet sich durch sein durchdachtes Bedienkonzept aus, dass von Grund auf f\u00fcr Ihr Android Ger\u00e4t konzipiert wurde. Dazu z\u00e4hlt die genaue Positionserkennung mit Hilfe von GPS, das die Anzeige aller Stationen in der N\u00e4he erm\u00f6glicht. Erkennung von ortungs Ungenauigkeiten und Optimierung der Fahrplansuche f\u00fcr Mobilnetze.Die Highlights sind:- \"Take me Home\"-Knopf, um von jedem beliebigen Punkt in Bremen und Umgebung mit einem Knopfdruck nach Hause zu fahren.- Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he werden metergenau angezeigt und beim Gehen aktualisiert - und das sogar ohne eine Netzverbindung!- Abfahrtsmonitor: Zeigt alle Fahrten von einer Haltestelle an- \u00dcbersichtliche Darstellung und Auswahl der Abfahrts- und Ankunfts-Haltestelle in auf der Karte.- Beliebige Ziele (Haltestellen, Stra\u00dfen, etc.) in Bremen und Umgebung k\u00f6nnen angefahren werden. Die Anwendung merkt sich bereits gesuchte Ziele, so dass diese nur ein einziges Mal eingetippt werden m\u00fcssen. Die n\u00e4chste Zieleingabe ist dann nur ein Knopfdruck!- Ein Grundkonzept der Anwendung ist, dass ihr Ger\u00e4t ihren Standort kennt. Dadurch entf\u00e4llt in der Regel die Eingabe der Abfahrtortes. Alle zu Fu\u00df erreichbaren Haltestellen werden als m\u00f6glicher Abfahrtsort direkt angezeigt. Nur bei schlechtem GPS Empfang werden Sie gebeten den Abfahrtsort selbst einzugeben.- Ergebnisse werden sehr kompakt und \u00fcbersichtlich angezeigt.- Netzplan mit allen Verkehrsmitteln (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram und Bus)  wird auf der Karte Dargestellt.

But of course it is critical to perform these calculations before each flight and to verify the results.Android is a terrific platform for keeping this information.This App makes it simple to maintain this information for a fleet of training airplanes or even for a single airplane. Check out the screenshots to see how simple this process can be.The W&B data is fully customizable. You can enter the specific data for your airplane. There is no limit on the number of stations. Various manufacturers use different methods to calculate the CG and this App supports a number of methods. The CG can be plotted in inches, or in total moment.The CG is plotted with both full and empty fuel so you can see the range of CG's that may be experienced during the flight.Also shown is the \"Excess Capacity\" - the difference between current weight and Max Gross. This is a number I often need to know if a student wants to bring a passenger along for the flight.The Moment Arms and the Envelope are fully updatable and can be customized to fit your airplane's numbers.CAUTION! Please consult your Pilot's Operating Handbook or Approved Flight Manual for complete Weight & Balance InformationDO NOT! rely on the generic W&B information provided here.----------------About CFI Tools ----------------I'm a Pilot and a CFII. I build these Apps and other software for my own use.Some other pilots saw them and said \"Hey you should sell those\".So here they are for sale. I hope you enjoy them.

{"title": "Parking Enforcer Lite", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Imense", "rating": "0", "Description": " ParkingEnforcer makes it easy to monitor and log vehicle parking durations in car parks. Simply snap a picture of each vehicle plate and our ANPR/ALPR (automated number plate/license plate recognition) will quickly and accurately recognise and transcribe the registration code for you. Plate codes can be logged and automatically compared against a database of previously observed vehicles to quickly find out parking durations. Images of parked vehicles can optionally be stored on SD card together with a time stamp and the registration code to serve as evidence in parking enforcement actions.The parking log can be displayed, sorted in different ways, modified, and exported to other applications using the standard CSV (comma separated value) file format. ParkingEnforcer also maintains a fully editable whitelist to mark vehicles for which no maximum stay is to be enforced. The log of stored plate codes is automatically purged after a user defined interval to prevent clutter.Unlike other scanning apps, this one runs entirely on your Android device without needing a network, so there are NO data charges or network delays whatsoever, and the number plates and images you take do NOT have to be uploaded to any server.Limitations:This is the lite version of ParkingEnforcer. It supports up to 15 vehicle registration codes in the database at any time, but unlike the full version it does not support certain features such as optional server upload and high-dynamic range recognition capabilities. It is limited to 20 reads per day, after which there is a short delay before recognition results are displayed to the user (full and pro versions do not have this delay).This version is optimised for UK vehicle registration plates. Please contact us for information on other locales.Customers who require more advanced recognition or integration capabilities may wish to upgrade to the 'Full' or 'Pro' versions. To upgrade to the professional version and enquire about volume licensing deals, international plate formats and other deployment options, or to hear about the wide range of other image recognition solutions offered by Imense Ltd., please email sales@imense.com and visit our website.Usage:(1) Hold your Android device horizontally, making sure the camera is not obscured. Try to line up the vehicle number plate such that it falls roughly within the green focusing rectangle.(2) Tap the camera icon on the screen to take a picture of the number plate. ParkingEnforcer will analyse the image you took and recognise and display the registration code. The registration string will be displayed in green (high confidence), amber (medium confidence), or red (low confidence). You can simply hit 'return' to take the image again. There is also a button and settings option to make use of the flash or torch light (only effective at short distances).(3) You can also tap the plate string to edit it or copy and paste it into another application. To copy the number to the clipboard, swipe it with your finger and then select 'Copy to clipboard' from the context menu. (4) Click the 'Enforce' button to log a parking observation for the vehicle. If the vehicle was previously seen in the log, then the duration since the first observation is displayed, together with the most recent observation time. If it has not been seen before, then a new entry is added to the log.(4a) The app also tells you if the plate appears in your whitelist. To add the plate to the whitelist, tap the 'Whitelist' button.(5) To take a new image, simply press the 'back' button on your Android device.(6) The name of the log and whitelist CSV files can be configured via the 'Settings' menu, and both files are stored on your SD card. To display or edit those logs using the app, tap the 'Lists...' button or choose 'Manage Lists'. The list of vehicle registration codes can be sorted and displayed using different criteria.

{"title": "US ATONS", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Michael+Mitton", "rating": "0", "Description": " The US ATONS App was created in an effort to offer the marine navigator a simple easy to use set of quick reference cards for marine navigation in US waters.  As part of the information package the International Flag Code System is also included.Lateral System, Non-Lateral System, Dayboards, Isolated Danger, Range Dayboards, Regulatory Marks, The Intercoastal Waterway [ICW], Special Buoys, Distress Signals, Operating \u201cRules of the Road\u201d, The Cardinal Buoys and the International Flag Code System are all here in one convenient location for quick reference when boating on US waters.The US ATONS are a set of 40 cards laid out in the format of a playing card. Each card has a corresponding icon designed to jump you directly to the page with the information for that navigation symbol. You may have to scroll left, right, up or down to display all the information on the card.  Once you are on a page you can scroll left and right to move through the entire deck of cards.  Pressing your back button will take you back to the icon page.  You may notice a slight lag due to page buffering if you are scanning through the pages quickly, please be patient while buffering catches up to your movements.Boaters call navigation rules \"The Rules of the Road.\" These rules define the roles and responsibilities of vessel operators.  If all operators obeyed these rules, most accidents could be avoided.  One of the reasons the Rules of the Road exist is to keep boats from colliding with each other and with other objects.  Collisions are the number one type of accident on the water; boaters should review and remember the Rules of the Road.The Rules vary slightly depending on whether you are boating on inland or on international waters.  As an example, when operating on inland waters, sound signals are signals of \"intent\"; when operating on international waters, they are signals of \"action\". Please note that marine navigational systems are not standardised worldwide. Our understanding is that the cardinal system is universal, but the lateral system is divided into two regions. Most countries operate with the port (red) buoys showing on the left hand side when entering a channel with an incoming tide, but in the Americas, the system is reversed.While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information presented by this App, it should only be used as a learning aid, and not to replace course materials and official publications.The developer welcomes any information about possible inaccuracies, and suggestions for improvements.

{"title": "Parking Enforcer basic version", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Imense", "rating": "0", "Description": " ParkingEnforcer makes it easy to monitor and log vehicle parking durations in car parks. Simply snap a picture of each vehicle plate and our ANPR/ALPR (automated number plate/license plate recognition) will quickly and accurately recognise and transcribe the registration code for you. Plate codes can be logged and automatically compared against a database of previously observed vehicles to quickly find out parking durations. Images of parked vehicles can optionally be stored on SD card together with a time stamp and the registration code to serve as evidence in parking enforcement actions.The parking log can be displayed, sorted in different ways, modified, and exported to other applications using the standard CSV (comma separated value) file format. ParkingEnforcer also maintains a fully editable whitelist to mark vehicles for which no maximum stay is to be enforced. The log of stored plate codes is automatically purged after a user defined interval to prevent clutter.Unlike other scanning apps, this one runs entirely on your Android device without needing a network, so there are NO data charges or network delays whatsoever, and the number plates and images you take do NOT have to be uploaded to any server.As well as handling poor and low lighting conditions, ParkingEnforcer also supports numerous formats of car, motorcycle, and heavy goods vehicle plates, including personalised and some international (non-UK) number plates.Limitations:This is the basic version of ParkingEnforcer. It supports up to 50 vehicle registration codes in the database at any time, but unlike the full version it does not support certain features such as optional server upload and high-dynamic range recognition capabilities. This version is optimised for UK vehicle registration plates. Please contact us for information on other locales.Customers who require more advanced recognition or integration capabilities may wish to upgrade to the 'Full' or 'Pro' versions. To upgrade to the professional version and enquire about volume licensing deals, international plate formats and other deployment options, or to hear about the wide range of other image recognition solutions offered by Imense Ltd., please email sales@imense.com and visit our website.Usage:(1) Hold your Android device horizontally, making sure the camera is not obscured. Try to line up the vehicle number plate such that it falls roughly within the green focusing rectangle.(2) Tap the camera icon on the screen to take a picture of the number plate. ParkingEnforcer will analyse the image you took and recognise and display the registration code. The registration string will be displayed in green (high confidence), amber (medium confidence), or red (low confidence). You can simply hit 'return' to take the image again. There is also a button and settings option to make use of the flash or torch light (only effective at short distances).(3) You can also tap the plate string to edit it or copy and paste it into another application. To copy the number to the clipboard, swipe it with your finger and then select 'Copy to clipboard' from the context menu. (4) Click the 'Enforce' button to log a parking observation for the vehicle. If the vehicle was previously seen in the log, then the duration since the first observation is displayed, together with the most recent observation time. If it has not been seen before, then a new entry is added to the log.(4a) The app also tells you if the plate appears in your whitelist. To add the plate to the whitelist, tap the 'Whitelist' button.(5) To take a new image, simply press the 'back' button on your Android device.(6) The name of the log and whitelist CSV files can be configured via the 'Settings' menu, and both files are stored on your SD card. To display or edit those logs using the app, tap the 'Lists...' button or choose 'Manage Lists'. The list of vehicle registration codes can be sorted and displayed using different criteria.

Instead of dumping data, Briefer analyzes weather information and gives you a plain English assessment of the flight conditions you will likely encounter, the flight risk, and the kind of experience and airplane capability you should have before attempting your flight.Just like your 1 800 WX BRIEF briefer, Briefer checks weather conditions at departure, destination and along your route of flight.  The briefing analyzes METARs and TAFs at departure, destination and enroute, as well as Nexrad weather radar images, Airmets and Sigmets relevant to your flight, saving you from wading through lots of raw weather data that is not relevant for your flight.The briefing is presented in easy to digest sections, with color used to highlight risk levels.  The summary section tells you what flight conditions to expect (e.g. IFR) and what level of pilot experience and airplane capability is required to safely complete your flight.  Details for each section (such as the actual METARS, TAFs, Nexrad picture and Sigmets relevant to your flight) are also available, with data shown graphically on a zoomable map, and in text form.Briefer uses data provided by NOAA's National Weather Service, and is for flights within the US only.  While we do our best to provide accurate information and analysis, the briefing provided by Briefer does not constitute an FAA-approved flight briefing.

{"title": "Parking Enforcer full version", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Imense", "rating": "3.3333332538604736", "Description": " ParkingEnforcer makes it easy to monitor and log vehicle parking durations in car parks. Simply snap a picture of each vehicle plate and our ANPR/ALPR (automated number plate/license plate recognition) will quickly and accurately recognise and transcribe the registration code for you. Plate codes can be logged and automatically compared against a database of previously observed vehicles to quickly find out parking durations. Images of parked vehicles can optionally be stored on SD card together with a time stamp and the registration code to serve as evidence in parking enforcement actions.The parking log can be displayed, sorted in different ways, modified, and exported to other applications using the standard CSV (comma separated value) file format. ParkingEnforcer also maintains a fully editable whitelist to mark vehicles for which no maximum stay is to be enforced. The log of stored plate codes is automatically purged after a user defined interval to prevent clutter.Unlike other scanning apps, this one runs entirely on your Android device without needing a network, so there are NO data charges or network delays whatsoever, and the number plates and images you take do NOT have to be uploaded to any server.As well as handling poor and low lighting conditions, ParkingEnforcer also supports numerous formats of car, motorcycle, and heavy goods vehicle plates, including personalised and some international (non-UK) number plates.Limitations:This is the full version of ParkingEnforcer. It supports up to 500 vehicle registration codes in the database at any time, and provides optional server upload. This version is optimised for UK vehicle registration plates. Please contact us for information on other locales.Customers who require more advanced recognition or integration capabilities may wish to upgrade to the 'Pro' version. To upgrade or enquire about volume licensing deals, international plate formats and other deployment options, please email sales@imense.com.Usage:(1) Hold your Android device horizontally, making sure the camera is not obscured. Try to line up the vehicle number plate such that it falls roughly within the green focusing rectangle.(2) Tap the camera icon on the screen to take a picture of the number plate. ParkingEnforcer will analyse the image you took and recognise and display the registration code. The registration string will be displayed in green (high confidence), amber (medium confidence), or red (low confidence). You can simply hit 'return' to take the image again. There is also a button and settings option to make use of the flash or torch light (only effective at short distances).(3) You can also tap the plate string to edit it or copy and paste it into another application. To copy the number to the clipboard, swipe it with your finger and then select 'Copy to clipboard' from the context menu. (4) Click the 'Enforce' button to log a parking observation for the vehicle. If the vehicle was previously seen in the log, then the duration since the first observation is displayed, together with the most recent observation time. If it has not been seen before, then a new entry is added to the log.(4a) The app also tells you if the plate appears in your whitelist. To add the plate to the whitelist, tap the 'Whitelist' button.(4b) If you would like the registration code to be uploaded to a server for additional logging or verification, then simply hit the 'Upload' button. The URL for upload and an optional user name and label (tag) can be configured via the 'Settings' menu.(5) To take a new image, simply press the 'back' button on your Android device.(6) The name of the log and whitelist CSV files can be configured via the 'Settings' menu, and both files are stored on your SD card. To display or edit those logs using the app, tap the 'Lists...' button or choose 'Manage Lists'. The list of vehicle registration codes can be sorted and displayed using different criteria.

Diese Idee haben wir Konsequent umgesetzt. Der A+ Fahrplan Ruhrgebiet Premium zeigt Ihnen stets alle Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he an!Mit dem \"Take me Home\" Knopf gelangen Sie so mit einem Knopfdruck von jeder Ecke in Bochum, Bottrop, Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Hagen, Hamm, Herne, M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, Oberhausen sowie in den Landkreisen Recklinghausen, Unna, Wesel sicher nach Hause. Entweder von Ihrem aktuellen Ort oder von einer Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he. Um zu einem beliebigen anderen Ziel zu fahren, ist das Konzept gleich. Ziel ausw\u00e4hlen, Haltestelle in der N\u00e4he als Abfahrt w\u00e4hlen (oder den aktuellen Ort) und los geht's. Oder Klassisch mit Start und Zieleingabe.Der Fahrplan Ruhrgebiet Premium zeichnet sich durch sein durchdachtes Bedienkonzept aus, dass von Grund auf f\u00fcr Ihr Android Ger\u00e4t konzipiert wurde. Dazu z\u00e4hlt die genaue Positionserkennung mit Hilfe von GPS, das die Anzeige aller Stationen in der N\u00e4he erm\u00f6glicht. Erkennung von ortungs Ungenauigkeiten und Optimierung der Fahrplansuche f\u00fcr Mobilnetze.Die Highlights sind:- \"Take me Home\"-Knopf, um von jedem beliebigen Punkt in Ruhrgebiet und Umgebung mit einem Knopfdruck nach Hause zu fahren.- Haltestellen in der N\u00e4he werden metergenau angezeigt und beim Gehen aktualisiert - und das sogar ohne eine Netzverbindung!- \u00dcbersichtliche Darstellung und Auswahl der Abfahrts- und Ankunfts-Haltestelle in auf der Karte.- Beliebige Ziele (Haltestellen, Stra\u00dfen, etc.) in Ruhrgebiet und Umgebung k\u00f6nnen angefahren werden. Die Anwendung merkt sich bereits gesuchte Ziele, so dass diese nur ein einziges Mal eingetippt werden m\u00fcssen. Die n\u00e4chste Zieleingabe ist dann nur ein Knopfdruck!- Ein Grundkonzept der Anwendung ist, dass ihr Ger\u00e4t ihren Standort kennt. Dadurch entf\u00e4llt in der Regel die Eingabe der Abfahrtortes. Alle zu Fu\u00df erreichbaren Haltestellen werden als m\u00f6glicher Abfahrtsort direkt angezeigt. Nur bei schlechtem GPS Empfang werden Sie gebeten den Abfahrtsort selbst einzugeben.- Ergebnisse werden sehr kompakt und \u00fcbersichtlich angezeigt.- Netzplan mit allen Verkehrsmitteln (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram und Bus)  wird auf der Karte Dargestellt. Fu\u00dfwege werden auf der Karte angezeigt.- Auswahl der Verkehrsmittel die man verwenden m\u00f6chte (z.B. k\u00f6nnen Busse abgew\u00e4hlt werden)- Ein Abfahrtsmonitor zeigt alle Fahrten von einer Haltestelle anHINWEISZur Verwendung der Fahrplanauskunft wird eine aktive Onlineverbindung ben\u00f6tigt, da die Daten vom Auskunftssystem geladen werden. Es kann keine Garantie f\u00fcr die Ausk\u00fcnfte gegeben werden.Fahrplanauskunft funktioniert in folgenden St\u00e4tten: Bochum, Bottrop, Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Hagen, Hamm, Herne, M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, Oberhausen sowie in den Landkreisen Recklinghausen, Unna, Wesel, L\u00fcnenKeywords: Fahrplan, \u00d6PNV, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Bus, Fahrplansuche Fahrinfo, UBahn, SBahn, Bahn, Ruhr, Nahverkehr, Fahrplan, Ruhrgebiet, VRR The basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe A + Timetable Ruhr Premium is simple: You drive by a station nearby from!

Or Classic with start and finish input.The roadmap Ruhr Premium is characterized by its sophisticated user interface that was designed from the ground up device for your android. These include the precise position detection with the help of GPS, which allows the display of all stations nearby. Recognition of positioning inaccuracies and optimization of the timetable search for mobile networks.The highlights are:- \"Take me Home\" button to go from any point in the Ruhr area and the surrounding area with a push of a button home.- Stops in the vicinity are displayed meter accuracy and updated during walking - even without a network connection!- Clear presentation and selection of the departure and arrival stop in on the map.- Arbitrary destinations (stations, roads, etc.) in the Ruhr area and the surrounding area can be approached. The application remembers already searched goals so that they must be typed only once. The next destination input is then just a push of a button!- A basic concept of the application is that their device knows its location. This eliminates typically the entry of the departure point. All stops within walking distance, are displayed directly as a possible departure point.

There are thousands of different Android phones, firmware versions, sensor chips and GPS chips, so some problems are inevitable.There are two reasons why Arrow can not save parking spots: 1) Some phones turn off the sensors when you turn the screen off. Arrow does not work when that happens, but you will get a message alerting you about the problem. It will still work in CarDock or Bluetooth mode, but you are also welcome to a refund. This doesn't apply to modded phones.Phones that shut down the sensors when the screen is off:\u2022 Motorola Defy\u2022 Motorola Atrix\u2022 Motorola Droid Bionic\u2022 Motorola Droid X2\u2022 LG 800\u2022 Lenovo Indigo\u2022 Huawei U8510\u2022 HTC Evo 4G\u2022 HTC Hero\u2022 HTC One S2) On some phones the accelerometer is not well-calibrated.

From cell-phones to personal computers, no human being today can escape it. Automobiles are no exception to this rule. With the ever changing emission laws of today, the one constant in the automotive industry is that things always change and will continue to do so. OBD II was designed from the beginning to do so as well. Late model vehicle systems are much more demanding, in both the amount of technology they posses and in the knowledge necessary to repair them. This work was designed to just that, a step-by step diagnostic approach to OBD II systems. It is also written with the State Inspections in mind. This is in direct response to the increasing adoption of OBD II inspections by most States throughout the country. OBD II repair don\u2019t have to be difficult or cumbersome and knowledge is the key to successful OBD II diagnostics and repair.

The free version of this app has been very well received. The full  version incorporates many suggestions that have been made to me.  If you already know the free version of this app, skip the introduction to see what the full feature version does in addition to the free version.No mobile network is required.  This app uses your phone\u2019s GPS, it will work where there is no network coverage (though you will need network coverage to share your logs and waypoints by email).What this application is notIt is not a chart plotter.  This application is intended for marine navigation.  Although it could be used by ramblers, that isn't the main intention. It does not display digitised charts, nor does it show you a Google Map view with your position displayed on it.   I believe it is highly irresponsible to encourage the use of Google maps to navigate boats.  Even in rivers and estuaries, Google maps contain no semantics for the sea whatsoever; no lights and marks, depths, rocks etc.  The application does allow you to send logs you have made to Google Earth, though, but only after you have completed the voyage.Full VersionThe full version of this App is now available for a nominal amount. The enhancements include:\u2022The number of waypoints you can have is not-restricted.\u2022Routes are included.  Routes are made of many waypoints, and the waypoint alarm can advance you to the next waypoint in a route.\u2022Waypoints can have notes, and the waypoints complete with notes can be shared with Google Earth.\u2022ETA to waypoint and VMG to waypoint are now available.\u2022Engine hours are added to the log service.  If you are a sailing boat, just check a box while your engine is running end engine hours are recorded.\u2022Cross-track error estimate now available.\u2022Crew on watch and total hours logged on watch can be recorded.\u2022The log service has a pause facility. \u2022A barometer monitoring service is available for phones that support a barometer sensor (not many phones do).

{"title": "BimBa: Smart Kid-in-Car Alerts", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Modus+Apperandi+LTD", "rating": "4.5", "Description": " It's all about \"Baby Left in Car\" and \"Forgotten Baby Syndrome\" (FBS). It happens every hot season, babies are left or unintentionally forgotten in cars, and the consequences are horrible. The reality is, it could happen to every one of us - even the most well meaning and responsible person. For this reason only, you cannot afford to ignore BimBa. BimBa is a smart warnings App, designed to alert you when you leave the car and perhaps your most precious of all, left or forgotten behind. BimBa is free of advertising and does not collect any information about you! How BimBa helps rescue and save the life of Left or Forgotten Baby in hot Car within 1 minute? When you get into your car and the car-bluetooth-device is turned on, BimBa will ask if you have a baby on board. Clicked \"No\"? BimBa will hold until the next time you access the car and activate the car-bluetoothe-device again. You are inside the car, still driving, already answered \"No\" to the \"Entering alert\" and you want to change it back to \"Yes\"? Go to info screen. Click on the \"Re-entry\" button and BimBa will ask you again if Baby on board. Clicked \"Yes\"? BimBa is triggered to a 'baby in car' state and ready for the Exit alert. You didn't respond at all? BimBa takes it as if you clicked \"Yes\". Want to change it back to \"No\"? Follow the opposite with the \"Re-entry\" button In info screen. When the car-bluetoothe-device is turned off or, you leave the car and gets outside of its range - BimBa will ensure its disconnection and launchs a three warnings cycle at 1-minute intervals, that someone is left behind in the car. If, for any reason, you do not react to the Exit alerts and, even the smartphone also left in the car, following the third unanswered alert and based on preset time & distance parameters, BimBa will send an emergency SMS about the situation to your predefined contacts, including coordinates and an active link to view the estimated car location on a map [displayed better on a browser]. BimBa never ending and it will continue to alert sequential cycles of three \"Exit\" plus SMS until the event is treated! BimBa runs using default settings. You can select and use the setting menu to personalize your messages and warnings and add your own images, texts and sounds. In any given situation, BimBa's status is always displays, updated and flagged on the status-bar, on its main screen and inside the Notifications screen. Practice BimBa to learn its behavior in various situations and statuses. BimBa enables you to \u201cTake a break\u201d and resume the service at any schedule that convenient for you. Without a definition of at least one contact, the emergency SMS is eliminated but, will expose you to the risk involved. BimBa's warnings override silent mode and darkened screen. BimBa operates in the background, activating warnings only when needed and planned to be on an \u201calways on\u201d state. Taking any actions that might disrupt its operation such as ending it by using the \"Active Applications\" tab or forcing the App to stop through the task manager or with an App killer, will prevent BimBa to fulfill its objectives. In such a case, restart the smartphone. Without having an activated Bluetooth device turned on in your car, correctly paired with your turned on and activated smartphone's bluetooth - BimBa will not operate as designed and will not meet its basic warning objectives. The first step is to read and accept BimBa's EULA (End User License Agreement). If you do not accept the terms of use, you will not be able to proceed further more with the installation and, do not install BimBa on the external-cd! The next step is to verify the connection (pairing) between your smartphone and the car\u2019s Bluetooth device, to set contact for the Emergency SMS and BimBa is ready for you and your kids.

As any crude oil driver can attest, crude oil weight can vary widely based on the gravity of the oil.  In order to be able to haul the maximum possible load without risking an overweight citation, the driver must consult a chart, if one is available, and make several calculations.  Know Weigh saves time and assists the driver by providing an easy way to arrive at the maximum load by simply entering the gravity of the oil.The Driver sets up the application by simply entering the empty weight of the tractor/trailer, the maximum legal weight, and tank capacity.  The app remembers this info entered at initial setup.At the well site, after the oil gravity is established, the driver simply enters the gravity into the Know Weigh app, which instantly calculates the maximum amount of oil, in both gallons and barrels that can be legally loaded on the truck.By maximizing your loads, Know Weigh should pay for itself the very 1st use.

Each checkpoints can be customized (MSL altitude, indicated airspeed, wind direction, wind speed, magnetic variance, checkpoint specific images, notes to write radio frequencies); some of the fields automatically populated for your convenience.3. Once checkpoint initial data is created this app will calculate (just like E6B flight computer) your ground speed (kn/hr and kn/min - used for descends), true heading, magnetic heading, fuel consumption, ground speed, time enroute, and even distance to horizon from the altitude you fly. You can add notes/reminders (radio frequencies, transponder codes, etc) and images specific to your checkpoint.4. Once your flight plan is in place you can save it to SD card on your device and adjust it to a specific weather condition just right before you take off next time - no massive recalculation needed - all numbers will be updated by this application for you in a few seconds.5. For your convenience you can generate a reverse flight by  ONE CLICK of a button \"REVERSE\". All time-consuming calculations are done seamlessly on the background for you by the application. All legs renamed, wind corrections and everything is calculated for you.6. You can load your flight plans from SD card at any time, whenever you fly. Simply update wind conditions to recalculate your flight data before you take off.7. Get in a plane and click \"FLY\" to activate your timer. Timer is visually shows you time you are flying the leg and time you have left to fly. 8. While flying you will be able to use a built in scribble - no more paper/pencil in the plane. Take notes on your device with your finger.9. You can use sectional/airport images you attached to each checkpoint - no more HUGE paper sectional. Zoom it in/out with simple two finger swipe or double click on the screen.10. You will be able to see the progress of the timer for each checkpoint! If you reach a checkpoint earlier/later than it was planned you can adjust your flight data.This application is not using internet connection, GPS or any other heavy battery consuming features. Recommended to be used on bigger screen phones and tablets. This application is especially convenient for night time flying - no flashlight needed to see details of your flight plan. It will run for hours on your android device, even with a very bright screen. The ability to pause the timer or start next checkpoint comes handy when the winds change while enroute and you may arrive to the next checkpoint sooner or later then expected.  I developed this application for my personal use, tested it at night and day time flying - pretty accurate in calculations and I find it reliable and very convenient.

What sets SkyDroid apart from other E6B replacement apps?Simplicity. Ease of use. Design with the cockpit environment in mind.Many flight computer apps have lots of rarely used functions scattered across many confusing pages. It's often hard to figure out how to do a simple calculation on the ground, much less in a busy cockpit.Designed by a CFI and aerospace engineer, SkyDroid keeps the complexity to a minimum and displays just the information you need in a clean, direct interface. SkyDroid doesn't try to wow you with obscure capabilities you'll never use on an actual flight. With SkyDroid, it's not what it can do that's special, it's how it does it.SkyDroid displays the important E6B flight parameters, organized within a few simple categories. All the relevant information is visible at any given time. Simply provide your flight parameters via a straightforward, reliable calculator interface, tell SkyDroid what you want to compute based on clear on-screen buttons, and press GO. SkyDroid\u2019s sophisticated physics models display precise results instantly. Even if you are interrupted or distracted mid-calculation, SkyDroid\u2019s clear visual feedback makes it easy to pick up where you left off.Whether you are a student pilot or an ATP, sometimes all you need is an E6B. SkyDroid is the E6B for today's flight bag, only better. With a little practice, SkyDroid delivers basic flight parameter computations easier, faster, and more accurately than the original \u2013 that's something few apps can claim.SkyDroid Features:- All the commonly used E6B functions plus more- A carefully crafted design focused on superior usability in demanding cockpit environments- High fidelity physics models engineered to deliver superior accuracy over a much wider range of conditions than a standard E6B, as well as many other alternative devices and applications- Guaranteed compatibility with the vast majority of Android phones and tablets- Responsive, unlimited technical support readily available for help with questions or problemsAdditional information on SkyDroid, including the comprehensive SkyDroid User Guide, can be found at our website by visiting:http://skyriversoftware.com  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skyriversoftware.birdbrain", "price": "EGP7.00", "date_published": "May 16, 2012", "email": "info@skyriversoftware.com", "downloads": "100 - 500", "category": "Transportation", "developer": "Sky River Software", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://skyriversoftware.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNGIjlt8qKDM470cutbeoSCfHitNmQ", "reviewers": "2"}

{"Description": " Univelo came to save you. At the beginning, Lukasz, Marc and Florent, the geeks behind the app, are just some bike sharing lovers. And this powerful love drove them crazy mad with mobile apps building power lust.After months of crafting, tweaking, sweating and bleeding, we finally gave birth to a miracle : Univelo.If we had to summarize Univelo in one word - which would be kind of a pity - it would be speed. This super hero launches, loads the map and downloads the stations list and their availabilities on less than few seconds. And it stills find some time to play with its kids.But the most awesome feature of Univelo is the available bike push notification. The idea is simple: you can select stations you wish to receive a notification when a bike is pushed in. So you can do your daily yoga (or go grab some pizza) and just leave when you receive the notification.Finally, it comes free and without ads!Notes:- Several animations like the slide to delete a favorite station from the list are not available on Android 3.0 and less devices.- The bike push notification uses the Google's \"push\" service, Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). In order to benefit from this service, you have to configure at least one Google account on your device.Feedback or bug?

{"Description": " Get real-time vehicle arrival times from Timisoara's public transport system. Use your device to download live arrival times obtained from the real-time GPS tracking units installed in all public transport vehicles (trams, buses and trolleybuses). The app connects directly to Timisoara's Transport Authority (RATT) servers and presents the arrival information in a format optimized for mobile devices.Features a utilitarian interface designed for quick browsing and information access. Arrival times are displayed using two formats:- N min the live time, obtained via GPS until the vehicle arrives in the station- HH:MM the scheduled vehicle arrival time. The scheduled time will most commonly be displayed when the vehicle has not yet left the end-station (i.e. no vehicle heading your way)Features:- Display live vehicle arrival times for all stations from a line. - Display arrival times for connecting lines - Does not require GPS activated on your device (saves battery)- A version with a smaller memory footprint version is available for users with lower storage capacity (520k)App website: http://mihaibalint.github.com/TimisoaraPublicTransport/Special thanks to RATT and the people at http://www.ratt.ro/forumRequires- Internet connection to download live times- Memory card access for caching  ", "operating_system": "1.6 and up", "price": "0", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mihaibalint.github.com/TimisoaraPublicTransport/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNEOO1bIf7oohnWkHLt_NJA_TigIUg", "developer": "Mihai Balint", "category": "Transportation", "reviewers": "1384", "rating": "4.627890110015869", "date_published": "July 29, 2014", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Mihai+Balint", "email": "nailuii@gmail.com", "title": "Public Transport - Timisoara", "downloads": "50,000 - 100,000", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.mihai.tpt", "content_rating": "Everyone"}

{"Description": " With the new logbook rules, they require the Licence Plate and Juristiction on the DDVIR (Drivers Daily Vehicle Inspection Report), instead of just the unit number. Even some logbook pages require the Plate Numbers too. Here is an app for those that switch quite a number of trailers on a daily basis, in a large fleet of units. Once a unit is stored in the database, it can be called back with all information at hand, instead of constantly running to the back of the trailer, getting the info, using it, and then switching again later. Then you are re-assigned the unit some time down the road, and have to manually get the info again.

{"Description": " The Bike Route Planner is a tool to assist route planning and navigation, and many other tasks related to cycling and walking.  Routes can be shared with others, and are then available at  www.bikerouteplanner.net.Routes can also be recorded, based on GPS readings. Tracks can be adjusted to the ground altitude.Possible routes are shown on top of Google maps, with colors representing different inclinations. This is of vital importance to bikers and hikers, that frequently prefer to avoid steep slopes. The route's highest and lowest points are also depicted graphically, through 'peak' and 'valley' icons.Routes can be analyzed on the map, by their coloring, or through their summary and details, accessible from the menu. They can also be saved on the phone's storage, for future reference. An altitude profile graph is available, to better visualize the elevations along the route.All data concerning routes and the actual user's position is only used internally to the application, and is not shared in any way. See full details here: http://www.bikerouteplanner.net/privacy.htmlInfo about bike routes is available for Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. Other countries' users can plan routes based on normal roads.The application is configurable. It may use metric or imperial distance units. It can be set to always show your location, and also to keep the map centered on it. Some data about you can be entered, to support estimation of calorie consumption.Although BikeRoutePlanner is not directed to car drivers, it is also possible to search routes for automobiles.Several new features will be added shortly.  Further down the development road-map is the implementation of several other features, that will make Bike Route Planner a complete companion for your cycling and hiking activities.BikeRoutePlanner was developed by a frequent bike commuter, that felt that some navigation and route planning needs were yet to be fulfilled.Altitudes may seem irregular due to GPS's altitude inaccuracy: this can be solved by selecting 'Simplify and adjust to ground', in the 'Route' menu.Avoid recording very long routes, with many GPS readings, as this can exhaust the phone's memory!

{"Description": " The Bike Route Planner is a tool to assist route planning and navigation, and many other tasks related to cycling and walking.  Routes can also be recorded, based on GPS readings. Tracks can be adjusted to the ground altitude.Possible routes are shown on top of Google maps, with colors representing different inclinations. This is of vital importance to bikers and hikers, that frequently prefer to avoid steep slopes. The route's highest and lowest points are also depicted graphically, through 'peak' and 'valley' icons.Routes can be analyzed on the map, by their coloring, or through their summary and details, accessible from the menu. They can also be saved on the phone's storage, for future reference. An altitude profile graph is available, to better visualize the elevations along the route.Info about bike routes is available for Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. Other countries' users can plan routes based on normal roads.The application is configurable. It may use metric or imperial distance units. It can be set to always show your location, and also to keep the map centered on it. Some data about you can be entered, to support estimation of calorie consumption.Although BikeRoutePlanner is not directed to car drivers, it is also possible to search routes for automobiles.Several new features will be added shortly.  Further down the development road-map is the implementation of several other features, that will make Bike Route Planner a complete companion for your cycling and hiking activities.BikeRoutePlanner was developed by a frequent bike commuter, that felt that some navigation and route planning needs were yet to be fulfilled.

{"Description": " Every single Charlotte Lynx Light Rail stop time in the palm of your hand!If you've tried the other apps, you'd know that they only display the next 3 or 4 times at a particular station.With this app, you can see all the stop times for all the stations for any day of the week, making it incredibly handy for planning your light rail trip ahead of time.Coming to Charlotte for the DNC? Use this app to efficiently plan your trips into the city and avoid the traffic hassle and street closings.Features Include:-- Integration with Google Maps to show you the exact location of any station on the map simply by selecting a menu option.-- Menu option to locate the nearest Lynx Station and its distance away from your current position using your phone's GPS, then either map it with Google Maps or pull up its times.-- Shows you all of today's remaining times for each station with a count down in minutes of the next three arrivals.-- Menu to pull up the full schedule for any station for any day of the week.-- Swipe the station times list left or right to view the previous or next station's times.-- Literally every single Lynx time in the palm of your hand. No more searching around or going to complicated URLs to find the times.About me:I am a computer programmer and first time Android app developer who just wasn't happy with the Lynx apps that were available on the Market.I ride the Lynx every day so I decided to take things into my own hands and give this Android development a try.So I taught myself Java and Android development and tried to come up with a better way to view Lynx times.I have personally used this app every day since I finished it.I have finally decided to make it available on the Market because I feel that Charlotte residents and visitors can benefit from it.I think once you own this app, it will be the only Lynx resource you will need, and you will use it every time you ride Lynx.

It is necessary to do an update with new options, of which users write us. For example, option of auto-update the database, widget for quick start, and so on. We need to test the program on hundreds of Android devices, to minimize the number of errors. We must create versions for other operating systems (iOS, windows mobile).

{"Description": " It is so easy to get out of your car and be thinking of anything else, but where you have parked. Auto Parking Reminder Pro is the most advanced car parking application that will automatically remember where you parked and save your altitude. Unlike other parking apps which require you to push a button to store your location, Auto Parking Reminder will do this for you without you even knowing it has happened. Auto Parking Reminder has recently been updated. It will remember what altitude your car was parked at. With a simple display on the side of the map you will be able to tell what level you have parked on. If you are on the same level as your car, the display will show a symbol of a person and car at the same height. If you are not on the same level the display will show if you are below or above your cars parking location. So now you can even find your car in multilevel car parks. Available in over forty different languages, Auto Parking Reminder will allow you to make a note, take a picture and even set a time limit, so those annoying parking police will never bother you again. How does it work?When you get into your Bluetooth equipped car, Auto Parking Reminder will detect that you are in your car. When you get out of the car, Auto Parking Reminder will detect that you have disconnected your cars Bluetooth device and mark your location. You don't have to remember to do anything, Auto Parking Reminder will store this location and whenever you have forgotten where or what level you have parked on, Auto Parking Reminder will have that location saved for you.Unlike other apps that run in the background of your phone services, Auto Parking Reminder has been designed to not drain your battery. It will only use your battery for the brief second when it detects you have parked your car or when you are actually using the app. You will not notice any significant battery use. How to use1. Go to settings and select your language and the Bluetooth device in your car. That is all you need to do to setup. 2. Now whenever you have forgotten where you park, just push where did I park. Easy ImportantFor Auto Parking Reminder to work correctly you need to have a Bluetooth device in your car. If you don\u2019t it won\u2019t be able to automatically remember where you parked, but you will still be able to use all the other features on the app.Android version three or higher is required.The GPS on your phone is not always accurate and Auto Parking Reminder can only be as accurate as the GPS signal on your phone allows it to be.Auto Parking Reminder needs to be running in the background if you close the app in the app manager it will not be able to notify you automatically, where you have parked.# car locator, where did I park, lost my car, where is my car, car finder, parking tracker, dude where\u2019s my car  ", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "price": "EGP12.83", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.auotparkingreminder.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNH2VT0OzdP3ILxSPlIIbP1ddFoddQ", "developer": "National Tenders", "category": "Transportation", "reviewers": "2", "rating": "3.5", "date_published": "January 8, 2014", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=National+Tenders", "email": "sethbeckenham@gmail.com", "title": "Auto Parking Reminder Pro", "downloads": "50 - 100", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotocto.parkingapppro", "content_rating": "Low Maturity"}
