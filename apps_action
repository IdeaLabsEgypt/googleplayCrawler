The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\"For all the simplicity of the game\u2019s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2018s is frightening. It\u2019s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It\u2019s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com  ", "content_rating": "Medium Maturity", "reviewers": "5365", "operating_system": "2.3 and up", "developer": "Scott Cawthon", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.scottgames.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE-9-iSAM8lgwvN-_H9BGkIioRF7w", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's", "email": "fazbearhelp@yahoo.com", "rating": "4.54836893081665", "date_published": "September 4, 2014", "category": "Action", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Scott+Cawthon"}

Rather than focusing on being an MMO it provides players with easy systems to sit down and survive the zombie infestation with their friends. Over the course of a typical adventure, groups will have a blast fortifying locations, scavenging for supplies, trying to live off the land and negotiating with other people. The game is being developed entirely with the community in focus, and tons of features are based entirely on feedback: Fortification: Players can build massive forts out of structural building blocks, or build onto smaller buildings in the world with barricades. It is also possible to create traps and intricate electronic systems. More options for building are constantly being added based on what the community requests. Survival: It is entirely possible to live off the wilderness by harvesting trees and rocks, growing crops and hunting animals down. What sort of survival stuff is added is entirely decided by the community. Explore: The game goes where the community wants it to. The initial release map is set on the lovely Prince Edward Island, but over the next few months many more locations will arrive for players to explore depending on what the community wants to see. Currently the island has plenty of interesting locations to discover and loot. Bandits: Players can choose to enter player versus player servers and battle other players to steal their gear. Banditry is highly supported with plenty of weapons and sneaky devices. Heroes: Players can join player versus environment servers to team up with other people, and easily create clans to play with their pals. Early Access: This is the first public release of the game, but new features and content are constantly getting added as a result of community feedback. You can see how far the game has come with the help of the community since the original testing prototype.
