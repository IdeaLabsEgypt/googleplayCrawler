You can also start a chat at a party, wedding, concert, and have everybody in the room join and create a photo album together.  All the pictures are shared only between the people in the room, and nobody else needs to know about them, if that\u2019s what you want. With Omlet you are the customer, not the product. You own your data, not us.  Omlet runs on the world\u2019s most advanced privacy protection technology developed in the Stanford Computer Science Department.   Omlet promises never to monetize your data.  You can link your chat account to your Box, Dropbox, or Baidu account today, with more choices in the future.  The company stores users\u2019 data for only two weeks to handle disconnected devices. ** ALL NEW FOR ANDROID WEAR **Omlet supports Android Wear so you can keep in touch better with your closest friends.  Notifications will automatically extend to your Android smart watch.  You can see text, pictures, and check-ins in a quick glance as well as reply with love, voice replies, or quick texts.  If you run the Omlet wearable app on from the \"Start...\" section, you can see the latest content or send a quick message to your recent conversations. Why Use Omlet:- FUN & CREATIVE: Create custom stickers, GIFs, edit photos, and more.- ON-THE-FLY SHARING: Start a chat on the spot to create photos albums with anyone nearby-- even people not in your address book.- SECURE & PRIVATE: Omlet doesn\u2019t store your data -- you do! In the cloud provider of your choice.- NO CREEPY ADS: No one likes ads that seem like someone\u2019s been reading your messages.  We don\u2019t do it and never will.

{"title": "FastFC Facebook Chat Messenger", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=insta7", "rating": "3.998415231704712", "Description": " FastFC is a Facebook Messenger App designed to bring you a Superfast FB Chat Experience. It has been crafted after a great deal of survey, public opinion & feedback. FastFC stands for Fast Facebook Chat.11 Reasons Why You Should Use FastFC instead of Other Messengers?1. Does not clog your memory (less than 1mb) and never slows down your phone- Extremely light on your phone, less than 1MB- Keeps background processes on your phone to a bare minimum & optimizes activities preventing phone slow down2. Turn off Notifications for Specific Irritating Humans- If you find someone irritating you, you can simply turn off notifications for that particular person- If you find more than one person irritating you, you can single out multiple people and turn off specific notifications- This prevents you from \"blocking\" individuals and coming across as anti-social3. Turn on Notifications from ONLY Your Loved Ones- If late at night, you want to turn your phone silent to the world, but remain alerted about possible emergencies, you can simply turn on notifications from only your loved ones4. Zero Traces of When You Were Last Seen- You don't need to worry about your privacy with respect to when you were last seen- You could always appear online, but doesn't mean you are actively using FB Chat. Just means you have FastFC installed on your phone5. Chat in 123+ Local/Regional Languages- If your phone has your local language keyboard with UTF-8 support, you can chat in your very own language6. Use The Cutest & Most Attractive Range of Emoticons/Emojis/Smileys- Choose and display symbols with great looking graphics & a 3D appearance- List of only those 200+ emoticons that you really use is handpicked for you- Widest possible range compared to all other FB messenger apps7. Share Files upto 50MB- Upload large sized photos, videos and songs from your phone- Easily access the uploaded files from any phone, tablet, laptop or desktop- Share the download links of these files with multiple friends8. Upload Multiple Files Simultaneously while Chatting- Upload more than one file at the same time- Continue chatting uninterrupted as your files are getting uploaded9. No Backup Worry, No Syncing Required, No Security Issues- All your chats are always easily accessible with one simple login- You don't need to worry about syncing or backing up your messages ever- Doesn't matter if you buy a new phone, travel to different countries or even format your phone- All your messages are securely stored on Facebook servers10. No Need to Add Your Friends or Contacts- No long hassles of adding multiple contacts- No need to worry if your buddy has the same messenger as long they are on FB- But if your buddy uses FastFC, your pictures, songs, docs & videos are instantly delivered11. No Phone Number Registration or Verification Required- Simple Access via your Facebook Login- Doesn't matter if you change your number- Doesn't matter if you move cities without a newly registered numberPhone Requirements- A decent size screen that makes your chats looks pretty and chatting easy(Doesn't mean small screens can't use it, its just not as pretty)- A fairly good data connection like WiFi or 3G that helps you shift swiftly between different views(Doesn't mean FastFC hogs on your internet data, it is optimized for low data rates)- A capable processor that can really push multi-tasking(Doesn't mean low end processors don't work, just stuff like chatting and uploading files at the same time becomes difficult as with any other app)LimitationsFB Stickers not supportedFAQ: www.fastfchat.com/faq.aspxPrivacy: www.fastfchat.com/privacy-policy.aspxTerms: www.fastfchat.com/terms-and-conditions.aspxSuggestions: www.fastfchat.com/feedback.aspx  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fast.com.fastfchat", "price": "0", "date_published": "July 28, 2014", "email": "contact@insta7.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "category": "Communication", "developer": "insta7", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://fastfchat.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHnWf7omRDs6pOQ4_9u8E9IjwSyAA", "reviewers": "631"}

{"title": "FoxFi (WiFi Tether w/o Root)", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=FoxFi+Software", "rating": "3.9356446266174316", "Description": " Turns your Android phone into a free WiFi Hotspot - no rooting or tether plan required. You can connect from any computers or tablets or even game console. Access Point is infrastructure mode with WPA2 security. FoxFi usage is covered under the same phone data plan you have and no tether plan needed. This saves you $20/month from your carrier.Currently WiFi mode may not support some phone models and we are working to expand the supported list. However Bluetooth/USB mode works for all phones. To check and see if WiFi mode can be supported on your phone visit http://foxfi.com/devicesAgain you do not need a tether plan or root your phone (otherwise this software will be meaningless).  It WiFi mode prompts you to call your carrier that means FoxFi has failed and you should use USB mode or Bluetooth mode instead.*If you have T-mobile, you should use USB mode with \"Hide Tether Usage\" enabled.*Sprint and AT&T has blocked the original FoxFi from Market. If you get error installing please use the second link from http://pdanet.co/android*Some Jelly Bean phones has locked-down the WiFi hotspot feature, because of that FoxFi will ask you to install a user certificate on those phones. The side effect is that Android system will require you to set a screen lock (and only allows Pattern, PIN or Password) when any security settings is changed. There is indeed a way to remove the lock screen while keeping the certificate. Please find it at http://pdanet.co/help/wifi.php--Android 4.4 will also show a warning message that says \"Your network usage may be monitored...\" as a result of installing the \"FoxFi Certificate\". The FoxFi certificate doesn't really do anything beyond turning on hotspot. If the screen lock or the certificate warning bothers you, you can actually remove the FoxFi certificate after WiFi hotspot is ready. That is because the certificate (as well as the VPN) is only needed during the \"turning on\" period.--To remove the FoxFi certificate, select \"Clear Credentials\" from phone security Settings (this removes ONLY the FoxFi certificate, all the stocked certificates will stay). If \"Clear Credentials\" is disabled, open the list of certificates and select the \"User\" tab, then open the FoxFi Certificate and scroll down to remove. Only after that your phone will allow you to set screen lock to \"None\".*AT&T Galaxy/Note phones: WiFi mode is now blocked if you updated to 4.3. Please use USB/BT mode.*The free version has a usage limit that requires you to restart FoxFi to continue using free mode. You can purchase the full version key to unlock this.Here are some tips to help your usage:1. On some models if you run into WiFi problem after using the Hotspot, simply reboot your phone and rename the hotspot before activating to clear the issue.2. For some Samsung phones if your computer is not able to get an IP address, try to turn on WiFi on the phone first and make sure it does not connect to any WiFi network, then turn on FoxFi.3. FoxFi is tested on non-rooted phones. If your phone has a rooted ROM it may or may not work.4. When WiFi hotspot is activated you may also see a hotspot notification of the built-in WiFi hotspot feature. Please ignore it. As long as you do not sign up for a tether plan you won't be charged.5. If you enter or change the hotspot password, make sure you rename the hotspot also before activating.6. Sometimes Windows need a \"repair\" on the WiFi menu to get a correct IP address.

So time to try something new, but it has to be pretty special, right? It's here, it's called Textra and it's a seriously beautiful way to text.Textra is the first messaging app that features the new Android L Material Design look you've heard so much about. It's delightful!Includes a bunch of great features like 800+ emojis, GIPHYs, heaps of color themes, dark modes, floating notifications, quick reply popup, better MMS and GROUP messaging (works with iPhones). Plus 'oh so easy' default or per contact customization for delivery reports, multiple signatures and notifications (icon color, led color, sound, vibrate pattern, privacy, repeat frequency, pebble alerts, floating, popup or simply turn off notifications; great for muting group conversations!). Now works with Pushbullet and Android Wear for SMS Quick Replying.It's pretty special; try it, tell your friends, shout from the treetops, but most of all enjoy it!Simple. Beautiful. Fast.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Dan in September 2014The VERY best FREE messaging replacement for the stock app on the galaxy S4. SMS is fast, and group chat MMS works perfectly as well. I am on Sprint (which supports MMS over WiFi) and Textra is the ONLY third-party messaging app that works with MMS on WiFi!!!!!! Plus it's FREE, no ads. BUT you MUST uninstall other SMS apps first, as they can interfere with Textra. After I did that it was PERFECT.NICE! Now works on KitKat - no more hangouts for me! they added Font Size too, nice.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Chase in September 2014Simple. Beautiful. Fast. Even the dev's know their app is just that good plus it's free. Bar none, this is the best SMS/MMS replacement app I've ever used. As soon as I launched it the first time, I fell in love. Upon launch, Textra sets up all the technical stuff automatically in mere seconds. And boy, the speed doesn't stop there. I have about 60,000 texts. With my stock app, I'd have to sit there and wait forever for various hiccups and loading and blah blah blah... I've tried every other SMS replacement app I could find. Textra is the only one that handles all of them without skipping a beat. It also lets you customize settings for each contact. Bubble color, icon color, notification sound, vibrate pattern, LED color... everything I want. And it just works. I don't have to fight the app. The only issue I had was getting my MMS messages to work, but I emailed the dev's, and within TEN MINUTES they responded. Within one night, we had about 18 or so emails back and forth, and by the end of it, they had pushed out a new version of the app and my issue was magically fixed! I have never experienced such great support for an app before. I was blown away. I look forward to all the love and care this app will receive! Do yourself a favor and get Textra now!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Andrew in September 2014Excellent free alternative to stock messaging. The program just works. You can set notifications, bubble colors and even delivery reports *per contact*. It's great with Google Keyboard, love it. Emoji's work perfectly with iPhone friends as does the group messaging. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Christian in September 2014This app is smooth and does the important functional things perfectly. It's not bloated like Go SMS and Handcent. Works great with iPhone friends for group messaging and emoji's very NICE! Also splits messages for CDMA networks as well. The timestamp feature per bubble (drag left) is SOOO slick. Great work! Good for those with limited eyesight too, as you can make the font size much bigger.Textra is a seriously beautiful, feature rich SMS and MMS replacement app.  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra", "price": "0", "date_published": "September 18, 2014", "email": "help@textra.me", "downloads": "1,000,000 - 5,000,000", "category": "Communication", "developer": "Delicious Inc.", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "4.0.3 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://textra.me&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHEQrkG3uwZTP7hndHMI8D13YDR9g", "reviewers": "50759"}

To keep things running efficiently, the people working in those locations need a fast, secure and reliable way to share information across computer networks. In addition, traveling employees like salespeople need an equally secure and reliable way to connect to their business's computer network from remote locations.One popular technology to accomplish these goals is a VPN (virtual private network). VPN One Click(Free) can provide a private network that uses a public network (usually the Internet) to connect remote sites or users together. The VPN uses \"virtual\" connections routed through the Internet from the business's private network to the remote site or employee. By using a VPN, businesses ensure security -- anyone intercepting the encrypted data can't read it.VPN One Click(Free) was not the first technology to make remote connections,but we are trying our best! Several years ago, the most common way to connect computers between multiple offices was by using a leased line. Leased lines, such as ISDN (integrated services digital network, 128 Kbps), are private network connections that a telecommunications company could lease to its customers. Leased lines provided a company with a way to expand its private network beyond its immediate geographic area. These connections form a single wide-area network (WAN) for the business. Though leased lines are reliable and secure, the leases are expensive, with costs rising as the distance between offices increases.Today, the Internet is more accessible than ever before, and Internet service providers (ISPs) continue to develop faster and more reliable services at lower costs than leased lines. To take advantage of this, most businesses have replaced leased lines with new technologies that use Internet connections without sacrificing performance and security. Businesses started by establishing intranets, which are private internal networks designed for use only by company employees. Intranets enabled distant colleagues to work together through technologies such as desktop sharing. By adding VPN One Click(Free), a business can extend all its intranet's resources to employees working from remote offices or their homes.

All incoming data enters through one port and is forwarded to the rest of the network via another port. By blocking direct access between two networks, proxy servers make it much more difficult for hackers to get internal addresses and details of a private network.In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, available from a different server. The proxy server evaluates the request according to its filtering rules. For example, it may filter traffic by IP address or protocol. If the request is validated by the filter, the proxy provides the resource by connecting to the relevant server and requesting the service on behalf of the client.\u2550.\u2665. \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550Benefits of our free Unblock Sites App\u2550.\u2665. \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2591\u2592\u2593\u2588\u25ba Hide from hackers and network spiesWith unencrypted web browsing every website you visit will be accessible by your internet service provider and anyone else spying on your network.

One of the very best call blocker apps for AndroidAutomatically intercept calls and texts from private and unknown numbersStop telemarketers, debt collector and sales people from wasting your time.Add Spam Numbers to be blocked directly or with one click from your phone call historyAutomatically hangup on or send calls to voice mail.You can filter unwanted calls to block calls using any of the 5 blocking modes as follows. 1.\tBlacklist mode \u2013 blocks all numbers in you blacklist.  Numbers can be added to the blacklist from contacts, call history, or manually entered.2.\tWhitelist mode \u2013 blocks all numbers not in your white list.  Numbers can be added to the whitelist from contacts, call history, or manually entered.3.\tContacts Only mode \u2013 blocks all calls from numbers that are not in your contacts.4.\tBlock All \u2013 Blocks all calls.5.\tAccept All \u2013 Accept all calls.Also blocks incoming text messages using the same rules as incoming calls.Support wildcard matching using the # character.  Example: Block all calls from area code 713, add 713-###-#### to your black list and all calls and text messages from area code 713 will be blocked.You can quickly add a range of phone numbers to the blacklist or whitelist by using wildcard characters. For example, if you want to block all the 800 numbers, you can add 800-###-#### to the blacklist.The # character is the wildcard, and is treated by Call Blocker as all digits between 0-9.  All other non-numeric characters have no effect, so using white spaces or dash signs is allowed but will not impact the matching process. The following three formats are regarded identical:1) 800820####2) 800 820 ####3) 800-820-####Country codes should not be used with wildcard match patterns.  for example, if you want to block all numbers from area code 213 in the United States, use 213-###-#### and do not use 001-213-###-#### or  +1-213-###-#### .Gizmoquip Call blocker is fully compatible with other Gizmoquip apps including SMS Scheduler, SMS Tracker and SMS Backup.

{"title": "WiFi Password Reader", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=David+Schulte", "rating": "3.7125353813171387", "Description": " Please note: This app requires root privileges!If you do not know what root and superuser are, do not load this app!Who needs to get his wifi network key fast, have to dig through a mountain of old records of his internet service provider. If you are lucky it is still under the router itself, but unless if you have already changed it. But what should you do if no documents exist? Then one may change his password and reconfigure all devices. That dosen't sound like fun.But your smartphone knows your password, why do not reads it out? With this app it is possible, regardless of the encryption your network.In addition, the program can be protected by a four-digit PIN. This must be entered before any network key can be displayed. The PIN is saved with root privileges and is also survived the 'clear app data' option of Android. This protection is only to prevent unintentional show of the network keys and worked only with this app! Who has forgotten his PIN must delete a specific file from /data with a root explorer. Every stranger who is smart enough to bypass this barrier will be also able to read out the WiFi config file directly, so this protection is sufficient.Android stores the network key in a simple text file that can be read, but only with root privileges.All other apps in the store either cost money , spy your phone with unnecessary privileges or spam your notification bar full with ads. This app dosen't show advertisements, hasn't internet permission, so it can't spy and it is free for you.Important information for Samsung users: Some devices (mostly from Samsung) save the network key no longer as clear text, but as a hash. This value can not be converted back to plain text form! At the moment I can not detect such devices automatically and the app shows only the hash as key. Known devices with this problem are: Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2/Note 3If the WiFi configuration could not be found, please let me get a message with the device name, model and if any is installed the custom ROM version.Please write comments and feedback in English or German, other languages \u200b\u200bunfortunately get no support.

There is no subscription fee of any kind, nor is there any reliance on external servers or Internet access.* FILE MANAGER: Use the file browser to upload and download content to and from your device. The file browser is a fully functional file manager, with the ability to move, copy, rename, and delete files and folders on the phone/tablet.   DRAG-AND-DROP file upload lets you quickly upload files by simply dragging them into the browser.  With Google Chrome, you can event drag-and-drop entire hierarchies of folders.  Uploaded files are queued/uploaded sequentially, so you can be repeatedly drag files/folders into WebSharing without worry.* MUSIC: A built-in music player enables you to stream music from your device to your computer.

Most carriers do not allow cellular access.Browser support: WebSharing supports modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.The music player requires Adobe Flash.  The video player can use either HTML5 or Flash.  The multiple upload feature requires Adobe Flash.Video format support: WebSharing can play videos using either an HTML5 or Flash-based video player.

{"title": "Morse Decoder for Ham Radio", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Wolphi+LLC", "rating": "3.7291667461395264", "Description": " Morse Decoder decodes Morse code characters through the built-in microphone of your Android device.Morse Decoder can be used by Ham Radio (Amateur Radio) operators or anyone else interested in decoding Morse code from a Radio or any other device.Morse Decoder includes a \"waterfall\" to show a frequency spectrum of about 50Hz to 2300Hz. A narrow band DSP filter can be set for the frequency of the Morse code tones by tapping the waterfall. The DSP filter is followed by an automatic gain control (AGC) to compensate for changing signal strengths.The detected signal will be shown as a graph and several algorithms will then detect the speed of the Morse code and convert them into readable text. Speeds of less than 4 Wpm (Words per Minute) to more than 50 Wpm can be decoded.For any question please visit our new forum at http://www.wolphi.com/forum/This is the first version of Morse Decoder.It has been tested on several Android devices and it performed very well or even better than PC based decoding software. However, since we are not able to test the performance on all 150+ Android devices there is the possibility that Morse Decoder will not work on all devices. If Morse Decoder doesn\u2019t work on your device you can uninstall Morse Decoder within 15 Minutes for a full refund (This is the time frame given by Google and I am not able to change it). If the 15 minutes passed and you are not happy with Morse Decoder email me as soon as possible at info@wolphi.com. Please include your name and the model of your phone in the email. I will then refund you the money as fast as possible. It is important that you include the model of your device. I will try to find the cause for the malfunction or include your phone model in a list of \u201cnot working\u201d devices.

Even though we focus on the best cryptographic experience in the Android email world, we try to provide a full functioning mail client with corresponding safety features in general.Features:* E-Mail Server: IMAP (incl. pushmail/idle), POP, SMTP and Exchange (>2007 SP1)* SSL with X-509 client certifiate authentication* An database in which the mails are stored encrypted* Special Attachment View (browse your attachments without checking single mails)* Dark and Light Themes* Switch for Html and Text view options* Peak Options for check intervals* Search Function for messages per FolderMain Cryptographic Features:* Private keys and passwords are stored in an encrypted database (Key-Store) and protected by a Master Password.* The security settings allow the configuration of encryption parameters, signature and certificate validation methods (OCSP and LDAP).* Full S/MIME and PGP Plain and PGP MIME support* Automatic selection of S/MIME or PGP for each recipient* Full support of Android Root Store* Certificate import of .crt, .pem and .asc formats* Certificate/Key import from KeyServer LDAP or HKP (HTTP)Informations about Private Key and Validity Handling:The application comes without a personal key pair (the users private and public key) - so it is fully functioning in the sense of sending and receiving emails as any other mail client and provides the correct usage of validation if the mail you receive is signed by the sender.For signing or encrypting a message it is necessary to use a private key you own. Turn to a Trust Center of your choice as a source of supply. You can find a list of trust centers, which are trusted within the Android world, in the Certificate Store (CA section) of R2Mail2. Please be aware that this app can only support Soft-Token in form of P12-files and will not work with smartcard-based certificates.The private key you use for signing and decryption is bound to the validity of the certificate. This means, that after the certificate is revoked or no longer valid (because the date stated in the field \u201cValid To\u201d of your certificate is in the past) signatures will not be possible. Nonetheless, we implemented the function to decrypt messages with private keys even with no longer valid certificates. So your messages will always be available to you, even with older keys.For more information visit http://r2mail2.com  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.rundquadrat.android.r2mail2license", "price": "EGP38.11", "date_published": "August 8, 2013", "email": "android@rundquadrat.at", "downloads": "1,000 - 5,000", "category": "Communication", "developer": "rundQuadrat OG", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rundquadrat.at&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNF68-9hyCt41K94OUHFdtRwOB5Dgw", "reviewers": "76"}

Three Really cool things about this app :1. It is UNIQUE in that this app will allow you to capture more text messages than a normal screenshot. This is because it allows you to select up to 10 text messages to include.2. It is UNIQUE in that you can select up to 10 text messages. And the text messages DO NOT have to be consecutive. So you can skip over the boring messages or the ones you do not want to include.3. It is UNIQUE in that it saves you the time and the hassle of editing screenshots by providing you the option to hide the person's name, their phone number, and the date / time. It PROTECTS their identity and their phone number!Many phones cannot create screenshots but with this app you can create a \"screenshot\" of your SMS text messages. The app actually loads up the text messages that you have selected and then creates an image from them.NEW with VERSION 4.0* Built in sharing of the image right into app.* Added an ICS ( Ice Cream Sandwich ) like theme.* Removed the USB warning some people were seeing.* Added a button to quickly scroll to top or bottom of long threads.* Add ability to automatically update the gallery.Uses for this app :* Post an image of those funny texts to Facebook.* Forward the image via Email. * Forward the image via Messaging ( MMS ).* Save a copy of the image for your records.* Post the image to a website.* Print the image.The images are saved to your phones external storage ( usually a SD card ) in a folder named \"ScreenshotMyTexts\", so you can access or send them later.This app does NOT use the complicated setup using the Android SDK. This app does NOT require your phone to be hooked up to your computer.This app does NOT require you to download a program to your PC.You only need this app to capture screen shots of your texts! That\u2019s it! Nothing Else!This app does not support screenshots of MMS ( Multi-media Messaging Service - ex: picture messages ). PLEASE NOTE - it does not support screenshots of images.It only allows up to 10 text messages to be selected at one time because if more texts were selected, the resulting image would be too large for many phones to properly handle.If you have any problems, feel free to email georgehammerle@gmail.com. We cannot respond to any problems if you leave them as feedback in the Google Market ( Google Play ).But if you need an EMAIL or PRINT OUT of every text or every text in a thread, download \"Email My Texts SMS\".

{"title": "Orxify", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Inetric,+LLC", "rating": "4.2833333015441895", "Description": " Protect your privacy, hide your location, and bypass site blocks.    Orxify (previously Anonify) is an add-on for Orxy (http://goo.gl/IQhvIc) that enables the Protect All Apps feature. It is not a stand-alone app, and does not create an icon when installed.    Orxify protects all the network traffic using The Onion Router (Tor) network. Tor encrypts the data and sends it through random points across the world to hide where the connection started. For example, while using Orxify, a website you visit might think you're looking at it from another country. It's basically a Tor powered VPN.    Unlike other Tor proxies for android, Orxify automatically manages all app traffic transparently, without requiring special configuration or root access. No configuration and a simple UI prevent mistakes that could potentially leak information.    Orxify also lets apps understand .onion addresses, which are special names that point to hidden services within the Tor network, sometimes referred to as the 'Hidden Web,' 'Dark Net,' or 'Deep Web.' Try it out: http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onionVisit http://goo.gl/GHjqgs for more info on Tor, including tips on remaining anonymous and protecting yourself.Tips:- If you log in to a website using your username and password, you are no longer anonymous to that website.- Logging in to sensitive sites while using Orxify, such as online banking or email sites, is not recommended. These sites usually have checks to verify your identity using your common locations. If you suddenly appear as logging in from another country, you may get blocked. You must also be careful to ensure proper HTTPS is used to prevent someone from seeing your password. It's best to simply avoid these sites to be safe.- Google search will sometimes present a CAPTCHA while Orxify is enabled. If it persists, try using another anonymous friendly search engine such as http://ddg.gg (or http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion)    When you first start Orxify, it will ask permission to start a VPN session with a warning. The Android VPN service is used only for controlling the network. Think of it as a VPN over Tor. No external VPN services are used or required.Email any bugs, comments, or questions. Not all devices support Orxify. If Orxify does not work for your device, email for a refund. 48 hour money back satisfaction guarantee.Note: Rooting is not required. No external VPN is used or required. Anonimizing traffic can be slow: it may be sent over many hops around the world. All supported traffic from all apps is anonymized. Unsupported traffic is blocked. No traffic will pass until the anonimizer is ready. Samsung devices running Android < 4.3 have demonstrated the most compatibility issues. The Samsung app com.sec.msc.nts.android.proxy interferes with Orweb, please disable it if you have connectivity problems: Settings->Applications->Application Manager->com.sec.msc.nts.android.proxy -> Turn Off.Follow @inetric for updates: https://twitter.com/inetricThis product is produced independently from the Tor\u00ae anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.

If you have problems please contact me first instead of giving a bad rating.If you consider to buy the full version of SpeedDial, please try the free version first!

The contact picker will come up to choose a contact.Q: Something is not working properly. What can I do?A: If the FAQ does not help, contact me using the 'Feedback' function in \"Settings\" view or 'Contact Developer' in the Android Market. I will try to support you as soon as possible. If you like this app, please rate it!Q: What is the difference between the full and the lite version?A: The lite version has the same features like the full version, except that it is limited to 12 shortcuts and that it does not have the grouping functionality. NO Ads! So please install the lite version first and check if it is running properly on your device!Q: My contacts do not have caller pictures. Can I nevertheless use SpeedDial?A: Yes, you can. But having caller pictures is the whole purpose of SpeedDial. If no picture is available, the Android logo and the name of the contact will be displayed.Q: Settings: What are the 'Shortcuts Group' sliders for?A: Define the number of visible shortcuts. If you have a set of shortcuts and reduce the number of buttons, the shortcuts will not be deleted, only hidden. After increasing the shortcut count, the shortcuts will be visible again. If the count is set to '0', the view will be skipped if you cycle through your groups.Q: Settings: Functionality of 'Short/Long Click Action'?A: If you have set up your contact shortcuts, two main actions can be performed. A short or a long click. By default a short click calls the number stored in the shortcut and a long click opens the context menu to start different actions like call number, send text message, view the contact, send a WhatsApp message, show the contact's address in Google Maps, send Email and also replace, remove or move a shortcut. Short and long click actions can be overwritten with other actions. Please note, if you change the 'Long Click Action', the context menu will not be available anymore. Instead you can use 'Actions' from the main menu.Q: What is the 'Actions' menu item?A: Lets you quickly replace, move, rename or remove a shortcut. Q: What does the Media scanner do?A: Use the integrated media scanner to scan for files on your phone without unplugging the SD Card. E.g. if you cannot see new pictures in the picture gallery. Q: Is this the final version of SpeedDial?A: No, SpeedDial is still in development.

No problem, GPS Phone Locator will find it. Want to find where your loved one is. No problem, GPS Phone Locator will locate your loved one. You do not subscribe to data service. No problem, GPS Phone Locator works with or without data. If you love your phone, you owe it to your phone to install it.The phone to be located must have GPS Phone Locator installed in it. In order to locate your phone, you need a second phone to find it.Location tracking is just one of the seven remote control (RC) commands that you can use on this app. You can use GPS Phone Commander to send RC commands. If the \"second phone\" does not have GPS Phone Commander installed, then you can just send RC commands in plain SMS text messages. These commands as listed below:1.??gps - Request its gps coordinates which can be entered into Google Map.2.??call - Request the phone to call you so you can listen in.3.??beep - Request the phone to beep even if the ringer is off.4.??lock xxxx - Lock the phone with a specified PIN.5.??camera - Request the phone to take a picture with the main camera.6.??flash - Request the phone to take a picture with flash.

{"title": "Last Alert Pro Find Your Phone", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=App-Different", "rating": "3", "Description": " The popular iPhone app now available on Android!Last Alert notifies you when your (or your child's) Android runs low on battery. -And in case you miss the alarm, we will email you the last known location just before the battery goes dead. - So you know where to look for it. Seriously, how great is that?(Just to clarify, you must install the app BEFORE you lose your phone.)*There are three main components to this app:1.) Audible Notifications - Last Alert will alarm when the battery is low. Select your alert sound and choose up to 3 alert intervals (20%, 10%, 5% etc.,) When the alert sounds, you or your child will know it's time to put it back on the charger. -Before the battery dies. (Kids pick up on this idea very well, and we've included several kid-friendly alarms to choose from.)2.) Email Alerts - in the event of a dying battery, the app will send out an email with last known GPS coordinates. Open the email on a computer or another mobile device, click the link and see the location of the device on Google Maps.3.) Compass Tracking - If you have Last Alert installed on a second device (iOS or Android), configure the alert messages on the first device to be sent there.You can then use the app's built-in compass to point you to the last known coordinates of the missing device. (Go 15ft Northeast, etc.,)Last Alert compares locations between the two devices, including elevation to help you determine if the missing device is on another floor of your house. Includes a sonar-style \"ping\" that increases as you get closer.Yes, there are other battery apps out there, and yes there are plenty of GPS apps as well. But nothing that provides all this functionality to help you find your missing Droid when the battery runs down. Kind of like good car insurance...you will really appreciate it when you need it.**** This app will need to be launched manually, but then will run in the background.**The accuracy of both the map and compass features are reliant on the coordinates provided by your droid device. Average accuracy varies between 5ft-20ft. Weak or obstructed signals, and other environmental limitations may further degrade accuracy. Regardless, we will at least attempt to provide you with a starting point to begin the hunt.

A POWERFUL (VERY VOCAL) paranormal investigation tool. Version 3NOTE: PLEASE TRY THE FREE VERSION PRIOR TO PURCHASING. Thank youIt's not flashy or pretty. It's not a game either, this App was designed specifically to be useful for Paranormal Investigations.This is a FULL VERSION of the revolutionary Ghost Hunting app called the EVPBOT. This vocal app automates the EVP sessions (electronic voice phenomenon) where it asks questions and records at the same time and saves the audio session to a file in your SmartPhone using MP4 format for downloading and easy analysis, or Android format. For proof positive, leave it in a quiet haunted area and leave. Come back in about 7 minutes and analyze the EVP session. To round out the main function, this app also has speech to text capabilities for ghost dictation, direct yes / no ghost touch communication and sacred sounds to attract spirits of any kind. *** IF FILE DOESN'T SAVE ON PHONE:This new version has two codecs to choose from (MP4 or Android) in the menu section. Select the Audio Settings on the pop up menu and select your codec.The file is saved in MP4 format therefore you need the MP4 codec freely available on Google Play. MP4 is efficient and clear, perfect for EVP analysis and most Android phones have the MP4 codec yet some models may not, so you can pick the Android codec in that case. It's easy to do, just go to the pop up menu and select the Audio Settings.Also check your settings for any permissions block like \"Settings>Advanced Settings>Protect SD Card\". Update the Android O/S if need be as it works best on Android 3.0 or better, preferably 4.1. This is a media intensive app, make sure excessive services are not running on your phone as well. The app has been thoroughly tested and works as described. You should have downloaded the free EVPBOT and put it through its paces first in order to make sure your phone codecs are compatible.HISTORY: We at Moditronic were on our way to developing an electronic device that does everything the EVPBOT is designed for. Since the advent of Android we decided to move all our electronic engineering to software smartphone development. The Android platform allowed us to add functionality to the EVPBOT that would have cost hundreds of dollars if we made the unit in our lab. Functions such as the ParaDictation feature, where if an EVP answer is detected the screen would write down the answer as heard by the microphone, would have been very expensive with a dedicated electronic device. We are in the process of designing electronic devices that would augment the functions of the EVPBOT. More to come in time.

Have your text messages read aloud but only when you provide the correct voice command to do so. When replying or composing text messages (SMS) you will have the ability to hear a preview and confirm your text before anything is sent...all hands-free!  Never have your incoming text messages read aloud in a meeting with Speak Drive Text since it will wait for you to tell it to read the text out loud. Of course, there is a setting that will allow this if you choose.This is simply the best and most unique text message reader on the market today!Speak Drive Text also works great with most Bluetooth devices.Example: you get an incoming text message (SMS), you then provide the correct voice command (\"Read Message\") and the app will read the text message aloud.  If no voice command is given then nothing is read aloud.  Once the text message (SMS) is read, you then have the opportunity to voice your reply or even call the sender, all while being completely HANDS-FREE!  Have your phone talk to you like Jarvis from Ironman.  This app allows you to have full text message conversations while being hands-free and eyes-free.There is also an auto-reply functionality.  Turn on the predefined auto replies or even customize your own auto reply for when you can't be bothered.Competing text message readers don't give you the option of having the text message (SMS) read out loud or not, it's either on or it's off.  Speak Drive Text has many features that will allow you to never toggle the service on/off but yet only have the app enabled when you want it.  For example, only enabled when connected to Bluetooth, or only when headphones are connected.  You can even turn on automatic replies while in a meeting.  You can also make it like the competing text message readers which will always read the text messages out loud.\"Can't say enough about the EXCELLENT product and the outstanding SUPPORT. Thanks Speak-Drive-Text Team...Good job\" - George\"The best so far...Still trying this app, but it is already working better then My Moto Speak.\" - Geoffrey\"One Of The Best App On Play :) This is the only app that doesn't require me to ever touch the phone. Other speaking apps like drive safely make you touch the screen when it doesn't recognize what you said. Speak Text is so much better. Amazing product and so simple!\" - ShawnWatch our app review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHXtncPmPs&feature=youtu.beFeatures:- Compose text message or call contact via Bluetooth button click or mic click.- Speak the voice command to get an audible output of the text message, otherwise nothing is read- Reply hands-free with a preview of your message and the ability to send as well as call the contact back- Seamless Bluetooth functionality allowing the user to text and drive- Extremely battery efficient since the app is not running in the background and is only launched when a sms (text message) is received.- Auto-reply feature with customized messages- Auto-read messages- Change voice commands- Bluetooth options- Shortcut to TTS settings- Different activation options - for example) only activate when connected to Bluetooth, or headphones, etc.Uses Google TTS (Text To Speech) by default, but also supports other language/voice packsTROUBLESHOOTING/OPTIMIZATION:http://speaktext.blogspot.com/p/troubleshooting.htmlIf you have any other problems with the app please email the head developer at mpmatt0@gmail.com.

The calls sent/received and the messages sent/received are not recorded in the standard log of the phone. The application allows you to manage reserved contacts from a special phonebook, where you can make calls and send messages without leaving any trace. Messages received from a reserved contact in the GhostPhone phonebook are not logged in inbox, but are registered in the GhostPhone reserved list of messages. GhostPhone is not present among the applications that run from the Home screen of your phone, but you must start it by calling the special number 9991. As you can see for yourself the features of the Ghostphone phonebook are similar to the standard phonebook.

GPS Tracker (aka PingBot) listens for incoming SMS/Text messages looking for the keyword 'ping' followed by your secret word.  Once it receives the proper command, it returns a link with your current location to the sender.  Simply install the PingBot SMS on your phone.  Give people your secret word (you can change it any time you want if they abuse it). When they want to know where you are, rather than calling, they text you with a ping (\"ping secretword\") and they will receive back a map location of where you are. If your GPS is off, it will attempt to enable it, determine your location, send it back as a text message, then turn off your GPS again. Perfect when you don't want to drain your battery with GPS enabled constantly. Unlike other mobile security products, PingBot SMS requires the least access your phone. It only requires the ability to receive SMS messages (to scan incoming messages for the ping and secret word), the ability to gather your GPS location, and then send it via SMS. There is no external service to sign up for; no need to visit a website to track a phone.

No coding required.Control Arduino and other microprocessor devices from your AndriodTM mobile via Bluetooth, or Wifi with 128bit securityNO Android Programming required. All screens, colours, font size and style are completely controlled by your Arduino.Use the free pfodDesigner app to design Android menus for Arduino and generate the Arduino code. No Android Programming required.Installation Guide: http://www.forward.com.au/pfod/Android_pfodApp/pfodAppForAndroidGettingStarted.pdfUnleash the power of your Arduino or other micro project with pfodApp. Show people that you are not just playing with circuits but building useful devices, like a garage door remotes, dimmable room lighting, etc, that they can control from their Android mobile. This one pfodApp can control multiple devices each with different functions.see http://www.pfod.com.au for examples of how to convert your existing projects to android control. Try out the pfodAppDemo first to see how the sample screens will display on your mobile.See the YouTube at http://www.pfod.com.au/KnightRider_pfodApp/index.html for an example of how pfodApp is being used to control Knight Rider Lights with an extensive set of options that required NO Android programming at all.Using the pfodApp on an Andriod mobile, your users can read text prompts, send navigation commands, traverse menu hierarchies, choose from single and multi-selection lists, input with sliders, and numbers and text and view data sent by your micro, in their own language.  This version of pfodApp supports non-English menus and screen texts.The contents of each screen shot here, including the language, is completely controlled by the microprocessor the app is connecting to.The Protocol For Operation Discovery (pfod) is simple request/response protocol for use with micro-controllers. Think HTML replacement, but with a much simpler format and much shorter messages designed for ease of coding in a micro processor. The pfodApp functions as micro-browser and the pfodDevice is the micro-server.The pfodApp does all of the Android stuff for you and remembers the menu hierarchy. You only need to code your micro to be a pfodDevice which responds to simple requests over Bluetooth or wifi/internet and sends back simple micro-pages in response. The text and user choices displayed by on the Android mobile by the pfodApp are completely controlled by what you code in your micro. No Android coding is required. The pfodApp handles it all.See the Installation Guide: http://www.forward.com.au/pfod/Android_pfodApp/pfodAppForAndroidGettingStarted.pdf forThis pfodApp has intentional limitations in functionality and the software will have unintentional coding errors.

Helps keep speakers organized an on time with an un-cluttered view of each heading/section of an outline. Includes a talk timer.Upon launching the app, there are now three buttons - two of which are completely new - one for creating a new outline and another for editing outlines you have already created and saved. The third button opens the talk timer outline screen, which previously comprised the entire app. It has not changed and you can deliver and time your talks with it in the same manner as the original app version.This update creates a new folder named \"Talk Outlines\" beneath the tablet's internal storage directory, which is typically named \"sdcard\" by most tablet manufacturers. Look for the \"Talk Outlines\" folder within \"sdcard\", or \"sdcard0\".Outlines created with the new editor will now be saved with the .outline file extension.If you are updating from the previous version, you will still be able to use any outlines you already have by browsing to the appropriate folder where they were previously saved. When you re-save a previous outline, it will be saved in the new \"Talk Outlines\" folder as a .outline file type.Download the Instructions/Tutorial file directly onto your tablet at:http://www.clicsys.com/taptalk/Tutorial.txtIf the tutorial opens in your browser, use \"Save As\" to save it to your \"Downloads\" folder. Open the Tutorial.txt file directly in the app for a demo which provides instructions.If you truly cannot afford this app, please contact the developer (admin@clicsys.com or visit www.clicsys.com/android and send a message or private posting)- we may provide it free of charge.

That's all it does and while you can set it call international numbers which cost money, our app will never initiate any phone call which you don't specifically assign.Read contact dataSign has to access the contact information  in order to create the contact list within the app and to initiate phone calls and texts to the appropriate phone number.Read phone state and identity\tSign accesses the phone state in order to correctly launch and initiate phone calls and texts.  It does not read the phone identity or use any personally identifiable information other than to make calls or texts.Modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contentsSign stores the contact database information on the SD Card.

Please try Gmail Group Share (Free) first to ensure you are happy with the app before purchase.Gmail Group Share allows you to quickly share via email with one of your Gmail contact groups.Important! If you're not seeing all your groups, go into the app Settings and enable \"Show Invisible Groups\" - they should then be visible.******New in v3.0!\"Keyboard\" feature added! This will let you easily forward emails to a group!It allows you to input groups directly into a field (e.g. the To: field of an email you're composing), without leaving Gmail.To use this, enable the keyboard in device input settings (ignore the warning - we aren't evil, promise), and then switch to the Gmail Group Share input device when you're in the desired field.Select a group and it will populate the field with the list of email addresses. It'll auto-switch back to your previous input method (or will prompt you to select one if you're on android 2.x or below).Clipboard support! Long press a group and select Copy to Clipboard, then Paste the email addresses wherever you wish (e.g. a To: field).******A simple example - you're out in the wilds somewhere and typing is tricky. You want to email some photos from your phone to your family.You already have a Gmail contact group set up with the relevant family email contacts.On your phone, you select the photo(s) in the gallery you wish to share with them, perform \"Share\".Choose Gmail Group Share, and you are presented with a list of your Gmail contact groups.Select one, and Gmail is started with the appropriate contact email addresses filled in and your attachment(s) made.No trying to type email addresses one by one. A big timesaver!You can also simply run the app directly and choose a contact group to send an email to.Set an option to use Bcc: instead of To: (so recipients don't see each other's email addresses).Note : if you enable \"Display contact count\" in the options, and the counts don't seem to reflect the number of contacts in a group when you view the contact list, there are two reasons this can happen.Firstly, some contacts are \"joined\" into a single displayed contact (but are counted multiply in the list).Secondly, Facebook contacts are included in the count but aren't displayed in the list for a group (FB security restricts other apps viewing FB contacts).Permissions :READ_CONTACTS - so it can read who is in which group.WRITE_CONTACTS - so it can modify and create new groups.GET_ACCOUNTS - so it can get the list of configured gmail accounts to select from.

Are you annoyed when you try to end a call with the back button and instead of hanging up, Android takes you the previous screen and the call in still active!? Now that is handled by Back Key Ends Call app!  It is that simple! Right after installation everything is set up and ready to go - the next time you call someone, all you have to do is press the back button and the phone will hang up.  Anyway, have in mind that if you press Android back key when the screen is off, nothing will happen and this is expected behavior as, for instance, you could hit the back key by accident when phone is close to your face.  Some other great features inside:   \u2713 No Internet access   \u2713 No Ads   \u2713 Silent mode - no reminders are shown in Android status bar or any other notifications   \u2713 Setting to lock the screen when you end call, even if you hang up without this app.   \u2713 Vibrate phone when you end call with back key (great for accessibility).  Have in mind that this app is extremely lightweight:   \u2713 The service is started only when a new call is initiated and is stopped always when the call ends.   \u2713 Small in size.   \u2713 No Internet access.

{"title": "DSP Audio Filter", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Wolphi+LLC", "rating": "3.5217392444610596", "Description": " The DSP Audio Filter is a tool that enables you to filter frequencies from an audio spectrum by using your cell phone\u2019s microphone. This app was originally programmed for Ham Radio (Amateur Radio) operators to remove unwanted background noise and improve SSB and CW signals (Morse Code) but it can be used in different other ways. For Example:  -Bird watchers can use it to filter out higher frequencies and eliminate street noise or other disturbing low frequencies.-Musicians can filter out a spectrum of specific instruments.The DSP Audio filter uses a freely adjustable lowpass and highpass filter which allows you to select specific filter frequencies and bandwidths.  A waterfall visually displays the incoming audio spectrum to better identify the wanted or unwanted frequencies. You must use a headphone to avoid feedback effects.Ham Radio Operator\u2019s:  Just place your phone\u2019s microphone close to your radio\u2019s speaker and listen to clear audio in your headphone.How to use:DSP Audio Filter uses a waterfall to display the incoming frequency spectrum. With 2 sliders the cut-off frequencies can be adjust. The areas which are covered by a grey blurry layer are cut out and they will not be passed through to the headphone. All other areas will pass the filter.The DSP Audio Filter can be used with 4 different sampling rates (22050Hz, 16000Hz, 11025Hz and 8000Hz) which can be set in the settings menu. Unfortunately not all devices support those sampling rates. The DSP Audio Filter will check for the supported sampling rates and only allows the selection of the supported sampling rates.For any question please visit our new forum at http://www.wolphi.com/forum/This is the first version of the DSP Audio Filter.It has been tested on several Android devices and has performed very well. However, since we are not able to test the performance on all 150+ Android devices it might not work on some devices. If the DSP Audio Filter doesn\u2019t work on your device you can uninstall it within 15 minutes for a full refund (this is the time frame given by Google and I am not able to change it). If the 15 minutes passes and you are not happy with the DSP Audio Filter, email me as soon as possible at info@wolphi.com. Please include your name and the model of your phone in the email. I will then refund you the money. It is important that you include the model of your device. I will try to find the cause for the malfunction or include your phone model in a list of \u201cnot working\u201d devices.

You can make new messages vibrate the phone. You can add friends, view their profiles. Profiles load full size display pictures in Talksalsa. You can suggest features to the developer, whenever you like.This is better than the website in an Android browser because it runs in the background, and is tailored to your screen. If you leave your Wifi/data on with your screen off, you'll stay connected. Great for when you need to run and want to keep talking to a new friend. Plus you can use your phone for other things and stay connected. Less RAM than some browsers. Whole app is only 200~kb.If you run API 8, please message me and I will make the necessary changes to allow you to run Talksalsa.Future features (weighted by user interest and requests to the developer) - Creating and editing accounts - Group conversations - Sound notification - Chat logging (currently pegged as highest todo when I have time) - Better theming - Better active chat managementChat logging solves crashes and hanging when you have long conversations running, my apologies for this current oversight. One user has helpfully reported that closing the window will speed things up again, but of course you lose your current chat log. It won't hang when logging is in use.(Question no one asks)Developer, why did you call it Talksalsa?Because I think Chatango sounds like Cha-tango. So I took chat, talk. Tango, salsa.Simple pleasures.I no longer have any interest in Chatango as a chatting site, but I enjoy working on Talksalsa and care about your experience with it.

I do not have any further information as to whether there will be a way to replace the functionality lost (viaa new API, or what not), so SynerGV may stop working at that point in time.  If a new method is made available todevelopers to access the information that we access now via SynerGV, then I will update the application at that timeto make use of that.  Until then, this app may (or may not) stop working on May 15th or some later point in time, andit may never work again.  I simply do not have the information to determine that.Voice users, please demand of Google to provide a legit API for 3rd party applications to be able to access the information that we use for this application!SynerGV is an application that connects your Android phone or tablet to your Google Voice\u2122 account, presenting a tablet-optimized and phone-capable interface to SMS and the most common Google Voice\u2122 functions for calling and account management.SynerGV is primarily built as a SMS text-messaging application, for which it continuously receives high regards amongst it's users on several platforms.While it does have the ability to place calls using the standard Google Voice\u2122 call forwarding schemes, thatis not it's primary purpose - but it does do it well, allowing you to use any phone configured in your Google Voice\u2122 account settings.Quickly and easily navigate to any of the various message boxes that Google Voice\u2122 provides-- all 13 of them -- and choose a range of messages to see, even going years back, if you would like, without having to scroll to the bottom of the list and get it to continuously load 10 more items every time it reaches the bottom.Quickly search your entire Google Voice\u2122 archive, by tapping the \"Search\" box above the list of messages, and entering in a search term.  Pages containing all messages that contain that search term will appear.SynerGV does not provide an interface that is obviously just a telephone sized old-school list re-scaled to fit your tablet.  It does provide a modern touch-screen, tablet-optimized and phone-capable interface.Virtually anything that you see on your screen with SynerGV running can be either tapped or held (long pressed) to generate some kind of an action. For example: Tapping on a message text, or holding on that message's header in the message list, will bring up a menu of available actions.When there's a message in the default Overview display, just tap it to bring up a menu of things you can do with / to that particular message.  Same thing goes for your contacts, and virtually everything else on the display.SynerGV does NOT provide a way to make telephone calls via WiFi for free.  If you need to be able to do that, go look up GrooVeIP, GVoice, or any other app that allows you to connect with Google Talk.  SynerGV is not intended to be the greatest looking Google Voice\u2122 app in the market, but it is intended to do what it does very well.  I hope you enjoy using it as much as I have writing it :)Things that are not quite working properly yet:Tapping notifications does not do anything.  I hope to have this solved in the near future.We want to be able to download voicemail files to the device for direct playback, rather than going through a proxy to load them via Flash.

Get started in 3 easy steps:1.  Download the free EZ Member Directory Builder Program from www.ezmemberdirectory.com2.  Build your directory3.  Invite your group to the directoryFive ways the EZ Membership Directory can help you:1. Quickly find other member\u2019s contact information such as their cell phone, email, and photos. Our easy-to-use member directory app allows you to conveniently stay in touch with other members in your organization. Just tap your smart phone screen to make a call, shoot a text, send an email \u2013 or just click an address to get a Google map to pop up. Other member\u2019s contact information is always up-to-date, when you need it \u2013 and where you need it! If you a member of more than just one organization, just one download of the app allows you to access other EZ Member Directory organizations you belong to.2. Communicate with other members with a mobile-directory. The EZ Member Directory has the option of displaying photos of members, spouses, and even kids \u2013 making it easy to put a name to a face as well as know who is with whom. When used for youth sports teams, church groups and scouting organizations, the directory can display the parent\u2019s names, photos and their contact information. More important, the directory can provide emergency contact information, as well as critical information such as nut allergies, diabetes, and other health alerts.3. Find other member\u2019s contact information fast with scrolling, push-button search and direct connect features. When working on projects, organizing or attending events, or just meeting for social activities, imagine how much smoother life would be if member contact information is at your finger tips. With the EZ Member Directory, you can even create sub-directories for committees, groups, or teams.4. Keep your contact information current with the directory-wide update feature. You will be sent an access code from the admin person for setup so you can update your own contact information \u2013 for whatever information you want to share. It\u2019s easy to update your information, and it\u2019s automatically displayed in everyone\u2019s directory as soon as you click Ok.5. Eliminate carrying around an easy-to-loose, out dated, paper-based directory. If you have only a paper-base directory you have to carry it around where ever you go, sometimes misplacing it, leaving it at home, or worse \u2013 losing it.

With only a user-supplied server address (no mods or plugins!), this app can retrieve the number of players, message of the day, a sample of online players (for 1.7 servers that have this feature enabled), network latency (predicted lag), and more! Server Status is also able to list Minecraft Pocket Edition servers on the local (wireless) network.Widgets and notifications are supported as well, making it even easier to check your favorite Minecraft server! Notifications can be set to trigger when a server is down or has a certain number of players, and widgets can show the number of players online for any number of servers you choose.--This is the paid version of Server Status, which means that there are no advertisements, and you are contributing to the developer in a more direct way (as well as continuing the development of this app). Thank you!--This app needs some permissions to run, namely INTERNET (needs to ask servers over the internet), ACCESS_WIFI_STATE (for broadcast addresses, to use for Pocket Edition servers) and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE (checks to see if wifi/mobile data is enabled, if not, alert the user accordingly).CHECK_LICENSE (to make sure the app isn't pirated - pro only)--Note: THIS IS NOT MINECRAFT ON YOUR PHONE, OR A POPULAR SERVER LISTER.

{"title": "SmartWatch Universal IM", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Unexpected+Development", "rating": "2.7257142066955566", "Description": " Enables your Sony SmartWatch to receive notifications from MULTIPLE popular instant messaging systems including Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, Kik, WhatsApp, Google Voice, and KakaoTalk (more may be added later). IF YOU DON'T READ THE DIRECTIONS, THE APP WILL NOT WORK.  Don't leave a negative review if you don't read the directions. NOTE: Facebook Messenger is a SEPARATE messaging app from Facebook.  It is not the main Facebook app.What sets this app apart from other notification apps is that each notification will bear a unique icon for the IM/chat system that generated the alert.  Additionally, there is custom formatting logic to make the notifications much easier to read for each chat network.  Unlike other multi-notifiers, it does not require any complicated 3rd party helper utilities to work.DIRECTIONS: Watch this YouTube clip:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fiB-TSuJMOr...Go to your phone's main settings screen -> Accessibility -> and check \"Universal IM Notification\".  THEN, go into the main SmartWatch application, click \"Applications\", click \"Universal IM Notification\", make sure \"Enable/Disable\" checkbox is checked, click \"Universal IM Notification settings\", make sure \"Active\" checkbox is checked.  If you use a task killer or if you do a \"clear data\" on this app, you may have to go back to the Accessibility menu and enable the app, and you may also need to toggle the \"Active\" checkbox off then back on in the app itself so the SmartWatch will re-register the extension.  If you are having problems after an update, uninstall the app, reinstall, and re-enable in your phone's accessibility settings as show above.NOTE: Most IM programs will not create notifications while you are using them in the foreground at the time the instant message arrives because it assumes you already know about the new message.  In this case, the SmartWatch will not get a notification because the IM program did not generate one.  This is the expected behavior.IMPORTANT:  This app is a notification manager that filters, reformats, and relays notifications generated from the IM system's official application (which you must also have installed) from your phone's notification bar to your SmartWatch.

Special audio filters even decode very weak signals through the microphone and make DroidNavtex a very affordable alternative to high priced decoders.NAVTEX broadcasts worldwide on 518 kHz and 490 kHz using a data mode called SITOR-B (amateur radio (Ham Radio) operators might recognise it as AMTOR).Get your copy of DrodiNavtex  today, and never be without up to date marine weather information and marine warnings again..You need to have a receiver which can receive 518KHz or 490KHz SSB to use this app!!An \u201cAuto mode\u201d finds the frequency and the sideband of the Navtex signal automatically. With \u201cAuto mode\u201d turned off the frequency and sideband can be adjusted manually.A built-in database stores the received messages which can then be filtered, sorted and shared. Messages can be deleted individually, in groups or by age.To save battery power 7 timers can be set to start DroidNavtex at a given time to decode messages. All timers can be set in local time or UTC.Great to use on all seagoing sail and power vessels, sailboats, power boats, fishing boats and commercial vessels.You can find a detailed user guide at www.droidnavtex.com I realize that the 15 minutes which Google allows is not enough for testing DroidNavtex.

Wanted to save that new contact without having to type in their name and address?  Sick of spam calls wasting your time?Fetch That Number can help. It can fetch the caller ID of Australian phone numbers. It uses the web to fetch the incoming or outgoing number's details while the phone is ringing - If the number is a known spam caller source, it will also let you know so you can ignore it rather than disturb your work.Once you have finished your call, you can then add the caller to your contacts list with a click of a button so it will sync with any of your registered Google accounts.Fetch That Number can also save history meaning you can look back and see previous searches and a search page so you can manually search for phone numbers.The data comes from a 'grey pages' reverse lookup service for Australia. This is a third party service (Reverse Australia). Asgard Designs are not responsible for data provided, we just provide a convenient way to use this reverse lookup service!NOTE: This will only be of use in Australia! We are looking at adding new countries in the future.Tested on HTC Desire HD, Xperia X10, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, HTC One X, Samsung Galaxy I II and III, Samsung Galaxy Note. If you have any issues, please contact us before posting feedback! If you have any issues, feedback or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact us!FAQDoes Fetch That Number fetch any number?Only those that are not in your address book and not international. Numbers that are missing matches can be reported through the http://www.reverseaustralia.com/ website.Can Fetch That Number fetch mobile numbers?Yes, however we have (anecdotally) found the hit-rate fairly low. Numbers that have been in existence for a long time seem to be more likely to be fetched.Is there a limit to how often I can fetch Caller ID?Yes, there is a limit of 40 basic reverse lookups and 20 extended reverse lookups per day.How long does it take for the app to reverse lookup a caller ID?It depends on your mobile network, and your reception at the time of call.In the real world, on an average network with 3g coverage, around 1 to 2 seconds is usual, however it can take 5 or more seconds if you have a bad signal.Can I install on multiple devices?You can install on any device tied to your google market account however your daily Caller ID lookup limit will NOT increase.Can Fetch That Number get private ('unknown' callers)?No, unknown numbers don't send any form of Caller ID or other identifiable information so we have nothing to search against.Will Fetch That Number's 'Add to Existing Contact' feature overwrite the current name, number and address?No.Fetch That Number will add new numbers and addresses only. after selecting a user to add you are given the option to replace their name, and if you wish to remove the old address and/or number you can do so in the edit screen.PERMISSION REASONSOur permission reasons for  Fetch That Number are as follows:-FULL INTERNET ACCESS - to access the reverse lookup service.READ CONTACT DATA - check wether the number is already added to your contactsWRITE CONTACT DATA - add the contact to your address bookDISCOVER KNOWN ACCOUNTS - we use this so you can choose which account you want numbers to be added to.VIEW NETWORK STATE - Need to know whether you are connected to the internet before trying to fetch a number.READ PHONE STATE AND IDENTITY - to know when a call starts and stops, and the incoming number being called.PROCESS OUTGOING CALLS - This is needed to check outgoing calls numbers in order to fetch from the lookup service.

Will not work with the Lite version of Torque.MAF Volts is currently in beta, meaning it should be accurate, but until I get some solid feedback stating its good then I would not suggest you use this value for tuning. Please email me with any feedback on how this PID performs and I will update the application.Installation Verification:1) Check to see that the plugin is listed in the \"Installed Applications\" of your Android device.2) Check that the plugin is listed in Torque under \"Settings\" -> \"Plugins\" -> \"Installed Plugins...\"Initial Configuration Instructions:1) Be sure to have an active internet connect for purchase authorization.2) Launch Torque and go to \"Settings\"3) Scroll down to \"Manage extra PIDs/Sensors\".4) Unless you have added any pre-defined PIDs in the past, this screen will not have any existing entries shown.5) At this point the installed PID plugins are loaded into Torque and purchases are validated. From the menu, choose \"Add predefined set\".6) If the purchase was validated corectly, you should see an entry for \"Mazdaspeed 2010-12\" in the list. If you do not see the entry, then the validation may still be in process or the plugin may not have been installed correctly. Go back to step 4, and wait 10 seconds or so before continuing. This should give all validations time to complete.

{"Description": " Small Call PRO handles incoming calls with a text message like notification. You could be texting, updating Twitter or Facebook, surfing the web, sending out an e-mail or in the middle of a serious game of Angry Birds, when you suddenly get a call or text message that disrupts what you're doing. Small Call PRO allows you to continue what you're doing with minimal interruption; a smart app for your smartphone.  Features one-line text notification at the bottom of the screen in an open app, scrolling incoming text messages, a one second ring tone option, and more.  Incoming calls or texts will not interrupt what you're doing any longer. See Small Call excellent reviews in PCMagazine.com, AndroidPolice.com, AndroidHeadlines.com, and Download.com. We have no competition. No other app can do what Small Call does. Small Call has been intelligently designed to work with other applications' exception handling criteria to deliver the best possible experience. Some less well designed applications are developed without exception handling in mind, and may have slightly different effect under the reigns of Small Call. As an example think of when a YouTube video is interrupted by an incoming call and the video is completely reset. These interruptions are few and far between, and if you encounter an application that does not interact with Small Call flawlessly please request that application developer to enhance their app with proper exception handling routines.Please, email us with any issues. We are continually working to make Small Call one of the best apps on the market and your input helps this process. Remember, we are doing what has never been done before on an Android phone and your endorsement is what keeps us improving.Thank you again for your support!Updated: May 3, 2014 1:46PM Want to go out or shop without overspending?
