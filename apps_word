For example:LOTOURTRYThis game starts off with simpler 3x3 word squares and works you up to the insanely difficult 6x6 word squares.  Are you up to the challenge?  Can you solve all of the word squares?The easier puzzles contain red tiles which are unmovable but already in their correct locations.  Green lines indicate the letters it intersects form a valid word.  No guessing if the word you arranged is valid or not.  If there is a green line then the word is considered valid.  You are provided some hints to start with.  A hint will move one letter in the puzzle to its correct position in the puzzle.  You may be surprised as to how difficult a puzzle looks at first glance but becomes easy to solve by simply using one or two hints.There is no timer, penalties or even score.  Your goal is simply to solve all the word squares.  You are given 30 unique word squares of varying size to solve along with 50 hints.  Additional hints and puzzles are available via in-app purchase including 10 crazy DOUBLE word squares (different words in each row and column).TIPS: Keep the following in mind when working with word squares:1) The same word will be used in the corresponding row and column.  For example:LOTOURTRYIn the example above the word that makes up the first row and first column is LOT.  The word that makes up the second row and second column is OUR and the word that makes up the final row and column is TRY.  A 3x3 word square is only made up of 3 unique words.2) Single instance letters in a word square will located somewhere on the (top-left to bottom-right) diagonal.3) There may be multiple solutions to a particular word square.  The word squares are created with more common words but when solving the puzzle you may use words from the SOWPODs word list.For questions, comments or to report an issue please visit Our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/pages/JSS/169346269861355 or Visit our website at www.jssapps.comor Email us at jssapps@gmail.com.or our Google+ page at:https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/111188384974678543797/111188384974678543797/posts/p/pubThank you,Enjoy!

In unserer Betitelung ist jedoch die Zielgruppe \u201eStudent\u201c genannt, da es Kategorien und Worte gibt, die einerseits f\u00fcr Minderj\u00e4hrige noch nicht geeignet erscheinen, andererseits zu infantil f\u00fcr Erwachsene sein m\u00f6gen.

A New and Unique Sudoku Word Puzzle game. \u25b6 From Game Inventor According to the game inventor, John T. Floros, Tapestry Twist was named after the motion of weaving letters in and out of colored threads to create a pattern or Tapestry. The Twist stems from solving Sudoku puzzles but with letters and not numbers. \u25b6 Tapestry Twist History Each puzzle is created by hand. In Tapestry Twist, you solve the puzzle by filling in the empty cells with a single character (from the word or phrase) that doesn't violate the Twist Rule. The Twist Rule is: Complete the puzzle so that each row, column, and group contains all the letters of the word or phrase only once. The word or phrase can be found in the grid \"in order\" only once. It can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, forward or backwards. \u25b6 New Features Tapestry Twist 2.0 comes complete with 80 puzzles, new intuitive design for improved game play, up to 15 multi-character words for increased difficulty, intuitive touch controls, an assist slash tool to deduce letter placement, multi-color grids for clearly depicting groups, and a puzzle-solver option capable of completing each word grid called \u201cHints.\u201d Hints allows the user to place the correct letter inside the puzzle grid in order to increase solvability. 5 Hints are given to start play with the option to purchase 20 Hints for $0.99 plus remove ads.
