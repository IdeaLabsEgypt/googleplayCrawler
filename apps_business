It will not root your phone/tablet. ***This add-on module enables the root file management features of FX File Explorer.THIS IS ONLY AN ADD-ON, NOT AN APPLICATION.  You must have FX File Explorer installed for it to work.  This add-on will not appear in your application launcher.  Its functionality is accessed within FX, by tapping the \"System (Root)\" item on the FX home screen.  Please install FX and try it out before purchasing: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx*** CRITICAL INFORMATION: READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING **** ANDROID L PREVIEW USERS *  You must install busybox to use root access with FX.  Use one of the popular \"busybox\" installer apps on Google Play.  Then open FX settings, select \"Root access settings\", tap \"Busybox Path\" and change the path from \"Use FX-Provided Busybox\" to one of the either /system/xbin/busybox or /system/bin/busybox.  This issue will be improved in a future release.* YOU MUST ALREADY HAVE ROOT ACCESS: This module requires that you have root/superuser access on your phone/tablet.  This module WILL NOT root your phone/tablet.  If you do not have root access, this module is useless.* Root access is intended for developers and knowledgeable enthusiasts ONLY.  Improper use of any root access application can cause your phone/tablet to malfunction or become entirely non-operational.  You assume all risk when using this or any root-access application to modify your device.***********************************************************General Features:* Browse, modify, and copy files to and from the otherwise inaccessible /data/app (installed Applications) and  /data/data (application data / configuration) directories.* Search for files and folders by filename, size, date, and type.* View and change permissions and ownership of files and folders.* Remount the root (/) and /system partitions as read-write.* Edit configuration files as root using FX's built-in text editor.* View any binary or text file using FX's built-in binary/hex and text viewers.Safety and Security Features:As FX is designed to be an \"everyday\" file manager, special care was taken to ensure that adding root-access features to it would not detract from that capability.  When the root module is installed, FX will still always use normal Android user access for file operations.  The root module is only enabled when you specifically open the \"System (Root)\" catalog from the home screen of FX. Security features can be configured to either warn you when you are using root access (the default behavior) or to require a PIN or password in order to use the root features.  These features can also be disabled, but they're designed to be very unobtrusive (e.g. warnings are only displayed after a configurable interval of non-root use).FX will display a warning on the home screen whenever the \"/\" or \"/system\" partitions have been remounted read-write, as it's a safety/security risk to not remount them as read-only when you're finished doing work as root.FX features a recursive checksum calculator to allow manual checking of file integrity between two directories, and the system can even incorporate permissions and ownership data into its calculations to ensure two directories are identically configured.  This feature can be accessed by long-pressing on a folder and tapping \"Details\", and then tapping \"Calculate Checksum\".

Filtering reduces data usage and dramatically improves performance and battery life when browsing.* Use the \u201cControl Panel\u201d slide-out to control site behavior: quickly toggle between desktop and mobile views.  Switch between \"HI-FI\" (full) and \"LO-FI\" (JavaScript-free) browsing experiences.* Optional Plus add-on lets you save content filtering, experience, desktop/mobile settings and more on a per-website basis.* Free, Ad-free, and Invasion-of-privacy-free: NextApp will make money only on the *optional* paid add-on.  Atlas DOES NOT collect information on your browsing habits or attempt to direct you to partner sites.  * Material Design-based user interface.By removing undesired content and letting you take complete control over your web experience, Atlas uses less data, lowering CPU usage and preserving battery life.  Sites load more quickly as large amounts of often poorly-written and inefficient JavaScript code related to advertising and tracking can be discarded.Additional features:* Dual-view mode (with paid Atlas+ add-on) adds the ability to view two sites at once.* Content-centric UI: No UI is visible when browsing, all available screen is used for displaying site content.Privacy features:* Sandboxed Private Browsing: Private browsing runs in a separate process without any access to your cookies.  This prevents the cookie leakage into private sessions that is common among other third-party browsers under Android KitKat.* Automatic search and suggestions from the location bar can be disabled (or only enabled when you preface a query with a slash (\u201c/\u201d).Atlas follows NextApp's standard free/paid model: a well-featured and ad-free free version with an optional paid add-on that offers more capabilities.  The paid \"Plus\" version adds:* Support for more than four tabs open at a time.* Dual-View mode to view two web sites at the same time.* The ability to remember your preferences on a per-site basis, such that specific web sites are retrieved in desktop/mobile modes or with or without content filtering enabled.The Plus license key may be downloaded here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.atlas.rk  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.atlas", "price": "0", "date_published": "September 19, 2014", "email": "android@nextapp.com", "downloads": "50,000 - 100,000", "category": "Business", "developer": "NextApp, Inc.", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "4.0.3 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://android.nextapp.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHKJeXhZvQ3WbnhEzZcMmMUr-N6RQ", "reviewers": "2249"}

It presents you with multiple locations of your choice.To add a new location simply press the '+' at the top right hand corner (note: you can add any location by choosing 'From Map' after tapping on the '+', then tap on the map to select your location).To reorder them simply long press a location and drag and drop it to its new position.

{"title": "iPR Scanner", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Documobi,+Inc", "rating": "5", "Description": " iPR\u2122 (intelligent Print Recognition) from Documobi Ltd makes conventional print digital and interactive, linking it to mobile marketing campaigns via a Brand\u2019s own app. Through this platform Brands can now ensure a unified, inbound consumer experience irrespective of the type of printed material or when it was printed. The existing Brand app (with iPR technology integrated via a simple SDK) can scan DM pieces, packaging, press ads, floor graphics, fabrics, POS, outdoor advertising and any other printed marketing collateral. QR Codes, NFC Tags, Watermarks and AR are not able to cope with all these consumer touch points in print, nor do they have the integrated backend capability necessary to create dynamically personalised messaging direct to a consumer\u2019s mobile in real-time, driven from the Brand\u2019s CRM system.This breakthrough technology makes print work harder and smarter, without changing any normal creative or printing production processes. Requiring no codes, tags or markers of any kind, iPR\u2122 collects and analyses user data when a recipient responds to a call to action and scans the piece with the Brand app.  This then, in real-time, points users to unique offers and experiences based on location, time, purchase history, demographic, inventory levels, weather or any other relevant parameter in the Brand database. Analytics are precise, meaningful and valuable.Brands, through their service providers, can now create an interactive and long-term relationship with customers through their mobile phone (or tablet), an absolute priority for all marketers.

The Vodafone Managed Browser application will not operate without the required back-end Vodafone Secure Device Manager console. The Managed Browser application provides a safe and accessible alternative to the native web browser for Android managed device users. Corporate IT administrators can customise and configure the Managed Browser to meet unique business and end-user needs, whether the need is to restrict web access from certain websites or to provide a secure internet \"\"kiosk\"\" for devices used as a mobile point of sale. By securing all internet transactions and limiting internet access to custom-defined websites in the Managed Browser's Kiosk and Restricted modes, the Managed Browser gives your business the benefits of mobile technology but with fewer distractions and risks.The administrator can remotely customise and configure the Managed Browser simultaneously with other MDM policies from the centralised VSDM web-based console, providing centralised and easy access to your business' mobile device management and security policies.There are two main steps required to customise the Vodafone Managed Browser:- Configure the Security Settings- Enable a Secure Browser Operation ModeTo begin customising the Managed Browser settings, login to the VSDM Web Console and Navigate to the Managed Browser settings page by selecting Configuration: System Settings: Device: General: Managed Browser.The Settings page is the primary location for creating and editing all Managed Browser policies. There are two views, Security and Mode. Select a tab to edit the associated settings:1) Security-Default view that provides options for enabling/disabling features in the Managed Browser that may be a security concern.2) Mode-Allows the administrator to configure the Secure Browser to one of two modes:- Kiosk mode restricts users to a single landing page in the browser.- Restricted mode employs either a blacklist policy for restricted sites or a whitelist policy to limit browsing to allowed sites.If you need assistance or are experiencing problems with the Vodafone Managed Browser application or VSDM service please contact your local IT support team.

There's an app for that. With Air Display, you can use your Android screen as a wireless display, to extend your computer desktop. In order for Air Display to work, your computer and Android device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.Like a wired monitor, Air Display works in two ways:(1) Extend your computer screen onto a second screen, or(2) Mirror the contents of your computer screen onto your Android screen.Air Display's performance is extremely responsive, employing a unique dynamic compression algorithm. On a typical Wi-Fi network, mouse cursor refreshes are indistinguishable from a wired mouse. Air Display works in both landscape and portrait configurations. Just rotate your screen, and it automatically reconfigures. Air Display makes a laptop much more useful by increasing its usable screen size.Air Display not only gives you a wireless computer screen extender or mirror, but also works as a tablet input device. You can use your finger to draw directly on the screen's surface. Try it with a calculator, painting tool, or music control surface. Simple gestures allow you to operate the right mouse button and scroll wheel. When you rotate the screen, or disconnect and reconnect, your windows are automatically repositioned appropriately, so you don't have to drag them back to the Android screen.Some great uses for Air Display include:- Fill your Air Display screen with your utility apps such as iChat, Mail, iCal, and Calculator.- Graphic design: Make Photoshop and Illustrator usable on your laptop by putting your tool palettes on the Android screen.- Music: Use your Android screen as a wireless control surface for Logic or Pro Tools.- Programming: Use the extra display area for such auxiliary development tools as Console, Terminal, and the Debugger.- Business: Move all of your iWork and Office palettes and inspector windows onto Air Display, and let your document fill the screen.On first launch, Air Display presents easy instructions for downloading and installing the free companion support software for your desktop computer.Mac OS X compatibility: Air Display Host requires Mac OS X 10.7 or 10.8 or later.Windows compatibility: Air Display Host requires Windows 7 or 8. (Windows 7 Starter Edition is not supported.)Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

{"title": "Call Informer (caller ID)", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Jesta's+Funhouse", "rating": "3.948608160018921", "Description": " Call Informer is a caller ID enhancement that shows an overlay with additional contact details on the Android incoming and (optionally) outgoing call screens.Nexus 5 / Kit Kat: If the app doesn't seem to work, or disappears quickly, try enabling \"Allow touches?\" in the preferences. Please let me know if this resolves the issue!!!! HTC Sensation owners!!! Please see notice at the end of this description.NEW: Try the new *free* demo version first to see if the app works with your phone!!!Call Informer can show:\u2605 Name (with Prefix on Android 2.0+)\u2605 Nickname (Android 2.0+)\u2605 Number and Number Type (Home, Mobile...)\u2605 Company\u2605 Job Title\u2605 Email address/Domain (NEW)\u2605 City, State\u2020\u2605 Country\u2020\u2605 Group association (NEW)\u2605 Notes field\u2020Note: Android versions below 2.0 don't separate the address fields, so the entire Address field is displayed on older Android versions.Call Informer differs from apps like Caller ID by Whitepages and Mr. Number Caller ID. These apps look for the information on the Internet, while Call Informer shows you the information you have already saved in your contacts. This means Call Informer will work on CDMA phones when the other apps can't. It also means Call Informer is more limited than these types of apps. Call Informer should work *with* these apps, so you can continue to use them.No Internet connection is needed for Call Informer! The extra information is read from your address book. Call Informer does not try to find this information--you need to manually update your contacts for the details to show on your call screens.FEATURES:\u2605 Show in a solid or transparent box\u2605 Change the background color (COMING SOON)\u2605 Set the font color and size\u2605 Optionally tap caller details to open Contact entry (new)\u2605 Optionally tap to hide/show caller details\u2605 Reposition the display to suit your phone (with preview)\u2605 Optionally show on outgoing calls\u2605 Show during conversation, or hide when answered\u2605 Designed to be small and efficient\u2605 Call Informer Preferences app in app drawer will allow you to report any Force Closes you have had; also allows you to send me a Debug Log in the event of a problemREQUIREMENTS:\u261b Must subscribe to your cellular carrier's Caller ID service. Without this, Call Informer will be unable to determine who is calling you! Most US carriers include this automatically, users in other countries should check your cellular plan. BOTTOM LINE: If your calls come in as \"UNKNOWN\" instead of a phone number, Call Informer WILL NOT work for you (Thanks @joey)\u261b HTC SENSE: Call Informer may overlap your existing Incoming Call screen info; I am working on some workarounds for this. For now I recommend turning on the solid background option, and use the Vertical Position preference screen to adjust the display for the best fit. If you disable tapping, you can still interact with whatever is behind Call Informer--it is just a visual overlap.TIPS:\u261b NO DISPLAY: If you don't see Call Informer at all after installing it, please power your phone down and back up. There have been some issues regarding certain devices (most often HTC) which don't want to allow the Call Informer service to start. Rebooting has been reported to fix this for some users. Also, try using the Screen Position preference to readjust the details box to fit in the screen boundaries.\u261b HTC Sensation owners: Call Informer has been reported not to work when your screen is locked. I am trying to find the solution for this problem. For now, if you own this phone I recommend waiting to purchase Call Informer.

That\u2019s right ... you love it, it has served you well, and you stand by it ... but could it do more?  Could it be easier to use?*** I have a lot invested a lot of myself in this app and want it to be the best construction calculator app.  IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY DIFFICULTIES, PLEASE CONTACT ME AT INFO-AT-BUILDCALC.COM - I REALLY WANT TO HELP! ***After nine months of development and testing by pros from around the world, BuildCalc for Android is ready to give you more - more function and more answers with less complexity, less hassle, and less confusion. MORE FUNCTIONALITY: \u2022 Advanced Baluster Function: Complete layout of railing and staircase balusters with less guess work - and with all the flexibility you need for every custom job. \u2022 Advanced Stair function: Stair layouts for professional results - including dimensioned drawings of your Stringer, Stringer Installation, and Finished Staircase. And you can email a PDF of these drawings right from BuildCalc so you can print them or share them. \u2022 Fence Function: Give BuildCalc a fence row length and it will tell you how many posts, rails, pickets, and or panels you need. \u2022 Interactive Functions: The Stair, Baluster, Compound Miter, Diagonal and Hip/Valley functions are now fully interactive. Want to change input values? Change the Run? Switch between Regular and Irregular Hip Roof analysis? You can do this and your results will be updated automatically - without you needing to remember what key to press. \u2022 New Full Daylight Visibility ModeMORE ANSWERS: \u2022 You are no longer tied down to: only one brick, block or tile size for the masonry function; a fixed number of drywall sheet sizes; only one footer cross sectional area; or one size of shingles and sheathing. If you don\u2019t see the size you want, you can add as many as you need. And for area input, you can store your custom sizes in Length x Width format, so you won\u2019t have to do mental gymnastics to figure out what was the dimensions for that last size you stored. \u2022 Want to cut your hip roof rafter using a miter saw ... or a circular saw using a hand-held protractor? With a tap of a button, BuildCalc will automatically switch between Miter Saw and Protractor results. BuildCalc can do this for Compound Miters, too. \u2022 Sheathing Angles, Purlin Angles, Gable Area, Backing Angles, Plan Angles, Rough vs. Finished Stair Layout Dimensions, Stringer Throat, Stringer installation dimensions ... and a lot more not found on other construction calculators. LESS COMPLEXITY AND LESS HASSLE: \u2022 Tired of having to press and press and press buttons to get the results of a calculation? BuildCalc puts an end to this. For all advanced functions, you get ALL of your results in list form with just one or two key taps. \u2022 And, rather than having to write down those results, all advanced functions allow you to save your results  so you can recall the complete results at your convenience. \u2022 Less \u201cquirks\u201d. Have you been annoyed by arcane key stroke sequences on other construction calculators? We are too. BuildCalc streamlined the keystrokes to do a better job of giving you less \u201cerrors\u201d and more results. Don\u2019t remember what you have to enter before a Hip Rafter or Stair calculation? Well, now you don\u2019t have to. BuildCalc will provide you with a check list of inputs and on-the-spot help to get it right. \u2022 Drywall and Masonry \u201cRoom Mode\u201d: If you have stored a Length, Width and Height for a room, BuildCalc will give you the Drywall or Masonry required for the walls and the ceiling / floor - with only a tap of the Drywall or Masonry button.

This relationship changes based on the properties of air (see kinematic viscosity on the settings tab) and on the friction value determined via the type of duct selected. Also, for the times when you want to get friction given CFM and Duct use the \"Airflow\" tab, select the \"ft/min\" checkbox and move the slider accordingly. There are many ways to drive the open variable.Accuracy:-----------------------------------------Calculations have been verified against ASHRAE fundamentals and several other references. There are more input criteria (such as duct material) than velocity, friction, and size mentioned in the review which the reviewer may not have taken into consideration.

You can also use VPN connections if you have a VPN client on your device.For slower connections, you might want to tweak your connection timeout parameter (by default 30 sec).Visit iVMControl's Facebook page here:http://www.facebook.com/pages/IVMControl/175381199162251** NOTE ** Please note that for ESXi *FREE*, Vmware decided to offer read-only access to the management APIs. This applies to all management applications, and is enforced by Vmware. What this means for iVMControl is that if you have a FREE ESXi, you will be able to use only the 'read-only' (monitoring) functions of iVMControl. If you have a paid license of ESXi (Essentials license is enough) this does not apply to you.Console support for ESX/vCenter. Requirements: Please note that regardless of the connection point (ESX(i)/vCenter), the console connects *directly* to the ESX host where the VM you want to monitor resides. This implies you need to make sure that your ESX hosts have IP addresses that are *routable*, otherwise you will not be able to access the VNC console; you need to make sure that the port configured (in the range 5900-5999) is allowed through your firewall for each ESX device you want to connect to. Furthermore, please make note of the fact that only the 8-character password is encrypted with the standard VNC client. All VNC client traffic is sent unencrypted across the network. If security is a concern in your organization, you need to be aware of this. You can disable your VNC terminal once you are done with the Console session (use Configure Console and disable VNC altogether). VMWare Tools needs to be installed on each and every VM that is monitored through iVMControl's console connection.

This app simplifies the process of collecting and recording information for presentation in a meaningful context.  For this or any app of this nature you must be familiar with and have knowledge of construction materials and measuring skills to do a load calculation. In other words, the data entered must be good and accurate for meaningful results.Comes with a \"Default\" project containing all the construction types.  Whenever new loads are created they may be copied from the Default project or any other load within the project.  Create new Projects by copying from the Default project or create your own template projects to improve efficiency.  Project may be filtered by staus - New, Template, Scheduled, or Complete.Comes with one Example Project in three stages.  The first stage \"Ex 1 Block\" is a simple block load analysis with inefficent ducting.  The second stage \"Ex 1 Block w/Improved Ducts\" shows the improved lower loads resulting from improvements in duct sealing as well as moving to R8 material in the ducts. The third stage \"Ex 1 Block w/Rooms\" is the same house with room by room loads.Loads: Above Grade Walls, Basement Walls, Ceilings, Floors, Partition Ceilings, Partition Walls, Doors, Windows, Skylights, Blower Heat, Infiltration, Ventilation, and Internal Gains.Opening Area Calculation: Calculates and automatically subtracts opening area for walls with attached doors and windows.

Enter the values \u200b\u200bcharacteristic of concrete and steel, safety factors, and you're done. You can either calculate the reinforced concrete beam but also verify.The calculation is performed through simplified options, for example:1. no account is taken of the concrete strength in traction phase;2. the neutral axis is imposed to about 30% of the height of the section. In this way, the height of the section is not low.

It can be tough to figure out what you should be charging to provide snow plowing services to a large property. With the help of the Snow Plow Bid Estimator, estimating snow plowing jobs will become easy. You will now be able to find the snow plowing bid price that works best for your snow plowing, lawn care, and landscaping company, by taking into consideration your equipment operating costs.By entering the cost and life span of such equipment as your snow plowing truck, snow plow and salter / sander, and entering the amount of time the job will take, you will easily be able to scale up your bids so that you make a consistent profit regardless of the size of the property.Don't forget to also use our other apps, such as the GopherHaul Mow Price and Mow Time Estimator, to figure out how long your landscaping & lawn care jobs should be taking.The GopherHaul Mow Time and Mow Price Lawn Care Business Estimators are the perfect addition to any landscape and lawn care business owner's tool box.

If we were all totally relaxed all the time, nothing would ever get done. Stress is a form of energy and only becomes a problem when it's channeled the wrong way, bottled up and focused inwards. A little bit of anxiety about presenting in public is natural and if that energy is channeled into the presentation itself and helps you to focus on preparing it properly beforehand, it can manifest as passion, because you really care about what you're doing and want to do a good job.This application, created by Darren Marks, one of the UKs leading and most effective hypnotherapists, builds on his very popular free app Relax Completely and is designed to help you to release the anxiety created by real or imagined bad experiences from the past and to program your mind to perform well in the future. The aim is for you to learn how to relax, breathe naturally and easily and even begin to enjoy those experiences.Darrens audios were recently described in Yoga Magazine as \u201cThe Ultimate in Self Help\u2026 The high quality recordings entertain, relax, entrance and help get results rapidly\u201d.

{"title": "Pic2shop PRO Barcode Scanner", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Vision+Smarts", "rating": "3.5999999046325684", "Description": " Build your own barcode-enabled app.   Simply configure the URL of your web application, and use pic2shop PRO to scan barcodes, transmit the code to your server, and interact with the results.The embedded web browser supports HTML5, CSS, cookies, javascript, https, etc.  You can easily and inexpensively build a rich barcode scanning app for your own or your company's use.  For example, give your employees access to a product information or an asset tracking app on their Android phone, over the internet or your intranet.Before you buy, you can try our free app pic2shop, to make sure the barcode scanner is what you need.  Pic2shop and pic2shop PRO read EAN-13 and UPC-A barcodes (the ones found on virtually all retail packages and books) and QR code. Pic2shop PRO also reads Code39, Code128, ITF and Codabar.WE DO NOT PROVIDE THE HOSTING SERVICE NOR THE WEB APPLICATION.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE WEB APPLICATION AND HOSTING IT ON YOUR OWN SERVER.There are four main configuration settings:1. Barcode formats: select one or more of: EAN-13, UPC-A, EAN-8, UPC-E, ITF (Interlaced 2 of 5), Code 39, Code 128, Codabar (NW-7, USD-4), QR that the scanner will try to decode. 2. Home Page URL: the url of the web page displayed when the app launches (optional).3. Barcode Lookup URL:  the url of the web page fetched when a barcode is scanned or typed.  The url must contain the string \"CODE\", which will be replaced by the actual barcode digits, and optionally the string \"FORMAT\", which will be replaced by the symbology of the scanned barcode.  That is how the barcode information is transmitted to your web app, and how the initial response is displayed to the user.4. Send GPS coordinates: add a \"&gps=latitude,longitude\" to the lookup URL (where latitude and longitude are replaced by actual coordinates).Please note that you can include as many parameters as you like in either URL, they will be passed as is to your server.  For example, you could give to each user a URL with a different \"&userid=NNN\" parameter to automatically identify them with the web application. Other options are: -sound, -vibration, and -go straight to scanner when the app launches.A quick and reliable to configure pic2shop PRO is to display a link to each user on a web page.  When they click the link after they have installed pic2shop PRO, the app will launch and the three parameters will be set automatically.  The link has the form:p2spro://configure?lookup={lookupURL}&home={homeURL}&gps={True|False}where any special character in lookupURL and homeURL is replaced by its % encoding.  For example, to make pic2shop PRO lookup the UPC database:p2spro://configure?lookup=http%3A//www.upcdatabase.com/item/CODEWe look forward to the creative uses you will make of pic2shop PRO.  Do not hesitate to drop us a line at the support email address to tell us about it.

Using DropBox, you can view and edit your projects on your PC or your android either.GanttDroid is a Project management application made for the Android platform, that enables you to manage all your projects anywhere you are.GanttDroid is not 100% compatible with Microsoft Project files.  If you need all the features of your MS Project files this app is not for you.However, GanttDroid is completely compatible with Ganttproject (see http://www.ganttproject.biz).If you believe that GanttProject is sufficient for you, then the combination of GanttProject on your PC and GanttDroid on your Android device will allow you to access and manage your projects on the go.You can import MS Project files in Ganttproject, save them as Ganttproject files and, from now use them with both, Ganttproject and GanttDroid.You can view the Gantt charts and modify any data of your projects. Any project created with Ganttproject or GanttDroid can be edited with both applications, and the result is the same in any one.Ganttdroid is integrated with Dropbox (see http://www.dropbox.com), so if you install the Dropbox client on your PC, you can access directly all the projects you have in your Dropbox folder from anywhere you have internet access.Other applications do not have all the capabilities of ganttdroid, or just allow you to display the projects, without the ability to edit.We recommend you to try the Lite version before purchase the pro, because we can't guarantee that the application will work on your device.

Are you curious if taking off next Tuesday will cause you issues with that vacation three months from now?  Quickly see how much PTO you'll have on a given date. This is both a simple and powerful PTO calculator.This paid version also includes a widget so you can see your current allocation on your home screen and uses Google Backup Service on devices configured to backup their data to Google.PTO Tracker allows you to see your PTO in either days or hours.  You can also take PTO in full/half day increments or fractional hours (up to 1/100th granularity).  Helpful Hints: - If you want to take hour increments rarely, just long-press on the date in full/half day mode to enter hours or fractional hours. Long-press will also give you other options, like bonus entry.- To go directly to a given day quickly, click on \"Week of\" in the entry screen.For when you occasionally get bonus PTO, but working overtime or a special occasion, you can long press the date to add in this bonus time.  Or select \"Advanced Mode\" as the input method and always have quick access to these rare values (more coming soon).If your company's PTO policies are different and this app does not support your needs, let me know and I'll try to make updates to accommodate you.  New features will be added soon to provide even greater flexibility.Explanation of permissions: No permissions are needed.  However, if you have PTO Tracker Free installed, the applications are linked (to import data), so Android will report this app has Internet permissions until you uninstall the free version.

{"title": "BluePiano Bluetooth Wedge", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=TEC-IT", "rating": "4.4285712242126465", "Description": " The keyboard wedge BluePiano injects captured Bluetooth SPP (SPP = serial port profile) data into arbitrary apps: the received Bluetooth data appears as entered manually. This new input method provides a Bluetooth-enabled soft-keyboard. It  captures data from Bluetooth SPP / Bluetooth RFCOMM devices (serial port profile) and forwards it automatically to the edit field of the active app. BluePiano works with all Bluetooth SPP devices (Bluetooth devices supporting the Serial Port Profile or RFCOMM). Special Android-enabled bar code scanners are NOT required. Please note: HID devices are not supported. BluePiano is used to automate bar-code scanning with external Bluetooth barcode-scanners like the Motorola/Symbol CS3070 or for generic data acquisition tasks (e.g. to capture external GPS or medical device data). English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish, Finnish, Hebrew, Serbian Cyrillic and Russian keyboard layouts are available BluePiano is easy to use, lost Bluetooth connections can be restored via a special key on the keyboard or via the notification bar (configurable in settings). For backup purposes BluePiano is also able to scan barcodes using camera barcode scanners (either using the built-in or an external camera scanner app).SECURITY: This App does not require Internet or SMS permissions. Your data is safe - spying/phishing/keylogging is impossible. FREE SUPPORT: In case of problems, questions or feature requests please contact support@tec-it.com (E-Mail/Skype). You may also give us a call. TEC-IT is located in Austria (time-zone GMT+1).KNOWN PROBLEMS: Some Android handsets are using buggy Bluetooth firmware and SPP communication may not work reliable. You will see SPP errors in the Bluetooth Device Manager of BluePiano (long tap on the ?123 key of the BluePiano keyboard). The following procedure may help:- Switch of Bluetooth and stop all related apps- Reboot handset- Switch Bluetooth on- Re-pair with your device- Use BluePianoMany THANKS for your comments and ratings!DEMO VERSION: A free demo with slight limitations is available in the Android Market.

{"title": "AWC Span Calc", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=American+Wood+Council", "rating": "4.75", "Description": " The American Wood Council (AWC) Span Calculator for Wood Joists and Rafters (Span Calc) performs calculations for all species and grades of commercially available softwood and hardwood lumber as found in the 2012 National Design Specification\u00ae (NDS\u00ae) for Wood Construction Supplement: Design Values for Wood Construction with March 2012 and March 2013 Addenda. Joists and rafter spans for common loading conditions can be determined. A span options calculator allows selection of multiple species and grades for comparison purposes.Maximum horizontal spans for joists and rafters are calculated based on the following assumptions and conditions: \u00b7 Joists and rafters are oriented to support vertical loads applied to the narrow (1.5 in. thick) face of the member, resulting in strong-axis bending. \u00b7 At least three joists or rafters are installed parallel to one another and spaced not more than 24 inches on-center, with properly designed sheathing attached on the top (compression) edge of each joist or rafter. \u00b7 Joists and rafters are single-span with adequate structural support at each end. The Span Calculator does not address cantilevered joists and rafters, multiple-span joists and rafters, or spliced joists and rafters. \u00b7 For joists and rafters, most building codes specify a minimum bearing length of 1.5 inches on wood or metal and not less than 3 inches on masonry or concrete. These minimum bearing lengths are to be used in the absence of calculated bearing lengths. Consult the local building code for specific requirements. \u00b7 Joists and rafters carry only combinations of dead load plus live load (D + L), dead load plus snow load (D + S), or dead load plus roof live load (D + Lr). The Span Calculator does not address wind load or seismic load. \u00b7 Buildings in regions with ground snow loads greater than 70 psf should not use the prescriptive provisions of the governing building code without approval of the authority having jurisdiction. Buildings in these high snow zones should be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.While every effort has been made to insure the accuracy of the information presented, and special effort has been made to assure that the information reflects the state-of-the-art, neither the American Wood Council nor its members assume any responsibility for any particular design prepared from this Span Calculator application. Those using this Span Calculator assume all liability from its use.

Your personal ClickCard* is easy to create and looks great.  Mail the ClickCard* to your contacts and they can also \u201cclick\u201d or \u201ctap\u201d on your business card (when they are using Android phone/tablet, iPhones/iPad, Mac, Windows PC or Linux PC). ClickCard* can also mail your personal data as a so called \u201dVCard 3.0\u201d.  This \u201cVCard 3.0\u201d can easily be imported in the Contacts/People app or Address book of almost all smart phones and PC\u2019s.You can also send your business card as picture. In this way contacts with smart phones, that do not support ClickCard*, can still view your business card.  ClickCard* has a lot of input possibilities. Just enter the fields that YOU need and you are ready to use the card. The input options of ClickCard* are:-> Enter name, function, company name, address with 2 ZIP-codes, telephone, fax, mobile, E-mail address.-> Enter links to your social media: Web-site, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter.-> Select 1 of the 5 different lay-outs. -> Select your photo from your Gallery. Select the size of the photo . -> Either use a background picture from your Gallery or 1 of the 5 default background pictures, one for each lay-out. -> Set the transparency of the background from 0% up to 99% with a slider. Some advantages of ClickCard* compared to paper business cards:-> ClickCard* saves the forest. -> ClickCard* is more flexible, change whenever you want. -> ClickCard* is \"clickable\".-> ClickCard* is probably less expensive.

The ClickCard* application reads/writes information in folder /sdcard/clickcard of your SDCard. Restrictions:-> The photo is not included in the \u201cVCard\u201d, because a lot of applications would reject that a \u201cVCard\u201d with photo.-> Clicking on a phone number does not work on  a PC, because a phone is not present on a PC.-> ClickCard* is not recommended when you use a large screen (let's say larger resolution than 1300x800 pixels, high resolution tablets).

This can add up over the year to be a substantial tax deduction that many business owners don\u2019t take advantage of. This simple app fulfills the requirements of the IRS for documentation needed to claim these deductions.We suggest that at the end of each month or year you email yourself a copy of the Biz-Mile Tracker report and store it in a save place so that you can print it out in case you are ever audited. This app is a real peace of mind for those who take these business mile deductions. Just do it at the start and finish of your business drive. You\u2019re business miles are now documented as required by the IRS!Employees: If your employer reimburses you for your business miles, this app will probably satisfy their requirement for documentation. You can send a Biz -Mile Tracker report to them by email or send one to yourself and print out a copy for them. How easy can it get?How it works:1. Enter a new record by entering the minimal information required by the IRS on the Add New Record page.2. When you are ready for a report of your mileage, you may view the totals on the View/Edit page and/or email a report of all information or send it to your SD Card.3. When you send the report by email at the end of the year, print it out, file and store it in case of an audit. The documentation from the report will be sufficient in reporting your business miles deductions in case of an IRS audit.

Maybe you want to call somebody at 8am Paris time. Or you want to attend a phone meeting which is held at 5pm Tokyo time.Of course there are plenty of world clocks available to give you the current time anywhere across the globe. However, with such world clocks you are still on your own if you need a time other than the current time. You surely went through the exercise of adding or subtracting hours to derive your time once you worked out the difference between the time zones.Did you make it to the phone meeting on time? Did you wake up the person in Paris? Or have you been late?The Time Machine relieves you from all these burdens. Unlike other world clocks the Time Machine goes a step further and allows you to enter a specific time in any one location and the app will automatically calculate the time in other locations of your choice.So the next time when you have to work out \"What time is it in ... when it is 5pm in ...?\" the Time Machine will have the answer ready for you in no time. No guess work involved.The user interface is clean and straight forward which makes the app very easy to use. It presents you with multiple locations of your choice.To add a new location simply press the '+' at the top right hand corner (note: you can add any location by choosing 'From Map' after tapping on the '+', then tap on the map to select your location).To reorder them simply long press a location and drag and drop it to its new position. You can also press the menu button at the far right of each location for more options.For changing the time uncheck the tick box saying 'Use current time'. The time slider appearing on the top of the screen allows you to manually change the time simply by dragging it.Features:=======\u2022 NOW: you can add any location to your list by tapping on the map to select it!\u2022 Drag and drop to reorder the cities in the list\u2022 Time calculator features fully customisable locations with local times\u2022 Immediate answers to questions like \"What time is it in ... when it is 5pm in ...?\"\u2022 Set specific times manually or view the current local time for any location\u2022 Very easy and intuitive to use world clock and world timezones converter\u2022 Slider adjustable time by simply dragging it across the screen\u2022 Time converter adjusts all parameters automatically to your changes\u2022 Map integrated for displaying locations on a map\u2022 Calculate the distance from your current location to the location on the map\u2022 No AdsGive it a shot and download the Time Machine world clock now!-------------------Below note is only for people in Russia or people who set their phone to a Russian timezone (ignore it if this does not describe you).--> Note: Russia has changed its timezone management a while back and not all the phones have adjusted to it yet.

Your numerical reasoning ability is not tested so you just need to calculate and answer each question as quickly and as accurately as possible.  As this is a type of speed test, a calculator should not be used.  You can prepare for this test by practicing multiplication, division and percentage calculations.  Reciting all of the times tables should also help you to succeed.It is important to answer the questions within the specified time of 15 minutes because a very high score could be achievable when given an unlimited time frame.  Therefore, speed is an important component of this test.  When you have completed all the questions you will be given a results summary and feedback for every question. This test contains 45 questions.  Remember that practice makes perfect.  Good Luck!Designed by TopTraining.

You can develop your user interface using HTML, Javascript and CSS \u2013 You can even use WebKit based CSS transformations and animations.*** You can also talk to me about per seat licensing *** Home ScreenYou can make Kiosk Browser SE the device home screen so that when pressing the home screen, or back button the user ends up in Kiosk Browser and not the \u2018desktop\u2019.Orientation LockKiosk Browser SE can lock the screen in landscape or portrait mode. No amount of rotating the device will make it change.Wake LockIf you don\u2019t want your kiosk to sleep you can force it to stay awake.Force SleepIf you don't want your screen on at all outside office hours you can specify when it should turn off. You can also specify when it should wake up again, read for the next day.Idle TimeoutIf there\u2019s no input from the user you can jump back to the start url after a number of minutes you specify.Capture ImagesYou can automatically capture images from the front camera and/or the screen when the user interacts with Kiosk Browser SE. You can have either image captured or both. If you have both each image filename is stamped with the same time. You can tag your kiosk files with a specific identity to help keep files unique. You can also activate face detection so that only those images that they system thinks have faces in will be saved for upload.** Face detection depends on underlying Android OS and the hardware used. **Upload ImagesCaptured images can be FTP\u2019d to a server, once complete they are removed from local storage to free up space. The target FTP path can also be specified.Remote LoadOn boot Kiosk Browser SE will check for a local configuration file and then optionally a remote one. The local configuration file can be automatically deleted once loaded so can be used for initial provisioning. Settings are saved internally so after configuration updates the kiosk can operate without the presence of the configuration file on the remote server. Remote configurations can be reloaded if required based on a timer.XML ConfigurationConfiguration is via XML, you can also configure with the preferences screen which can generate xml for provisioning larger installs. NotesQ: The button bar is visible on my device.A: Please note that if you are running Android >=3 you will not be able to hide the button bar - this is a restriction placed by Google (they assume everyone is a consumer). If your device is rooted then there are ways to kill the bar completely, you can ask me how this can be done.Q: I get force closes when trying using face detection.A: Face detection requires quite a bit of CPU disable it.Q: Face detection does not work.A: On some devices, particularly those running non standard or third party ROMs, face detection will not work. If you are running a ROM not provided by the manufacturer try face detection after installing their ROM. Q: My screen doesn't go off at the time specified in the Display -> Sleep Time settingA: If you are running from an external power source ensure that the system setting Application Settings->Development->Stay awake is not selected. In The systems settings Display Settings ->Screen Timeout pick a low timeout, like 15 seconds. In Kiosk Browser SE set The Wake lock to \"Full\" and enable  \"Disable keyguard\".

By author chopping said, \"speed-reading is not required,\" said reading skills by applying the technique of consultants. Even at a speed of normal, book I read properly is to learn, you can practice, efficient.In the shortest amount of time, surely, we describe to lead to results, the principle of strategic reading. Daily consultants are thinking, in the shortest amount of time, know-how that applies to reading, how to get the maximum output is written.It is also the basic principle for not only that reading, to increase the intellectual productivity of you.And will not stick to the body, even reading a book.Skill is not up even after reading the book.Habit of reading a book made. In spite of reading a book a lot, it does not become the body easily. It does not come tied to the outcome of the work.For business men are having trouble like that, I wrote this book.This document is the crown of a \"consultant\" as if on, I wrote about how the reading to get the maximum results in the shortest amount of time the consultant practice.I think is to practice it and learn the knowledge and skills from this, people called consultants, including myself, and it is probably the most good race. I wrote it to condense the know-how.\u00b7 I have to finish proposal, a presentation by tomorrow. I want to put the results in a short period of time.\u00b7 Because we need to tackle a new field of work that was never done, reading is necessary., In less time, with the information quickly, you want to be grasp the essence.- I want to know the secret between that help actually in work and reading of \"connection\".-As a consultant, I want to know how to wear in a short period of time a wide range of knowledge.I think those having you inspired many people for such.Oishi Tetsuyuki (get Oshii Tetsuyuki)Born in Tokyo in 1975.

Changes within the lens in your eye cause light entering the eye to be scattered rather than focused precisely on the retina, thus creating more glare. The normally clear lens located inside your eye may start to discolor making it harder to see and distinguish between certain shades of colors. The tear glands in your eyes will produce fewer tears.Increasing the the amount of light, brightness called LUX can improve vision.Bright Light Therapy - is used to gradually shift sleeping patterns to what we consider normal. For treatment, the timing of light exposure uses a full-spectrum light (90-100 CRI) usually 10,000 LUX in intensity, for 30-90 minutes. Blue wavelengths -- boost attention, reaction times, and mood are about 5000 degrees Kelvin.  As published in the The Journal of the American Medical Association researchers learned that bright light resulted in a modest improvement in dementia symptoms. Specifically, the use of bright daytime lighting:\u00b7\tReduced cognitive decline on a mental status exam by a relative 5%.\u00b7\tCut depression symptoms by a relative 19%.\u00b7\tCalmed slow increases in functional limitations by slightly more than half (53%).Dementia and Alzheimer's - For these people shadows in a darkened room can become something else, often menacing, and can lead to confusion and depression.

Handy for a builder, architect, designer or home owner looking to improve energy efficiency in their project and in dong so save money. Also useful for quickly comparing the energy efficiencies of different finishes (i.e. single glass pane compared to low E glass and curtains, etc; the results can be quite surprising and cost effective).50 materials are already provided for you to use (i.e. bricks, windows, blinds, curtains, insulation batts, wall finishes, flooring, etc) although you can add your own if required. The finished set of materials you can also save to reuse later.Also provided is a calculator for working out the energy transfer through a given area that has a certain R-Value or U-Value with inside and outside temperatures. Useful for seeing how much heat you loose or gain in different conditions; i.e. how much heating or cooling you will need to maintain the temperature difference and therefore the cost advantage of improving the level of insulation.The calculator will work either in R-Value's or U-Value's either in metric or imperial. You can actually change these on the fly and the calculator will make the required conversions for you in context; i.e. also acts like a R to U Value converter and metric to imperial converter at the same time.Also the results of both calculators can either be shared by email or copied to the clipboard for use in other apps.Included in the app are full instructions and helpful advice on how to get the best from the calculator and its results.If you have any suggestions for new features or improvements, please do let us know, thank you.
