Since the game is still in beta, one part of the world is a bit more laggy than the other parts (Because of buildings and zombies spawning). This will obviously be fixed in later versions. In the meantime, Here is how you can resolve any performance issues while playing \"Final DayZ\":- Make sure all applications are closed and not running at the time of you playing the game. Many active apps can cause the CPU in your device to cook, so making sure all applications are closed and inactive will greatly increase overall performance.- Your device greatly contributes to the performance of the game. Having an older device can result in performance issues, so make sure you have a newer device or a device with a decent processor.
