Similar to the Western card game rummy, mahjong is a game of skill, strategy and calculation and involves a certain degree of chance.The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although some regional variations use a different number of tiles. In most variations, each player begins by receiving thirteen tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the fourteenth drawn tile to form four groups (melds) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, stolen from another player and thus melded, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honours (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However there are many regional variations in the rules; in addition, the scoring system and the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used.

But it will be fun when you go through with it if you like solitaire game on windows, it will be the same.Klondike is a patience game (solitaire card game). Many people refer to Klondike as patience or solitaire, it being one of the better known of the family of patience games.RulesTaking a shuffled standard 52-card deck of playing cards (without Jokers), one upturned card is dealt on the left of the playing area, then six down turned cards (from left to right). On top of the down turned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most down turned pile, and down turned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.The four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player will have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:Turning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.Turning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.Turning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.Turning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.Turning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.Please see more details.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nanosoftware.solitairekd", "category": "Card", "title": "Solitaire KD", "email": "gamedevme@gmail.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "developer": "Smartmoap", "price": "0", "rating": "4", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "content_rating": "Everyone", "date_published": "April 19, 2013", "reviewers": "99"}

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=bit+Time+International+FZE", "Description": " Blackjack, also known as Twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more decks of 52 cards.The player or players are dealt an initial two card hand and add the total of their cards. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count their own Ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. By virtue of this, approximately 31% of the cards in a deck are ten point cards. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a \"hit\" (taking additional cards) to bring their total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called \"busting\"). The dealer will usually take hits when his two cards total less than 17 points. Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. The dealer will lose if they bust, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a \"push\" and the player typically doesn't win or lose money on that hand.

The only exceptions are the ace alone is worth 1, but if it stays with other cards worth 11, and the Joker you pay 20 points.Examples of combinations of closing: if one closes with all the papers related pay 0 points. Instead if you close points are added up the points of closure.Examples of combinations of payment in case of closing the game we have to count the points made to pay by cards that we were not able to bind, if we have in hand a set, a quatrain, and a 6 and J will pay 16 points,If we find combinations such as 2 quatrains not to scale type 4 9 4 6 and another card say a K and it can not bind a wildcard as the quatrains are complete and pay him 20 points plus 10 points of K, 30 points are the points that we will pay.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Deiuquy", "Description": " Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer, meaning that players compete against the dealer but not against any other players. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The object of the game is to \"beat the dealer\", which can be done in a number of ways:* Get 21 points on your first two cards (called a blackjack), without a dealer blackjack;* Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or* Let the dealer draw additional cards until his hand exceeds 21.The player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add together the value of their cards. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count his or her own ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a \"hit\", or taking an additional card. In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the highest score that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (called \"busting\" or \"going bust\") results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts. If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called \"soft\", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card can always be less than or equal to 21. Otherwise, the hand is \"hard\".The dealer has to take hits until his or her cards total 17 or more points. (In some casinos, the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17\u2014e.g., an initial ace and six.) Players win if they do not bust and have a total that is higher than the dealer's. The dealer loses if he or she busts or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a \"push\", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand.Good luck!

If you get a pair, click each card to discard it.- Play continues, with each player drawing cards from the player on their right and discarding any pairs.- Eventually one player will be left with the Witch (the \"Old Maid\") card.That ends the game, and the possessor of the Witch card loses the game.Don't forget to check our Games section for more fun games...

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Biti", "Description": " ObjectiveThe 500 is a game of tricks with Trump, which is played 4 players, in team of 2. The partners sat one opposite the other. One uses 46 cards (either: two joker and the ACE to the Four). The play is played in four stages, that is to say: gives cards, bidding, take the kitty and play the cards.DealDeal, bidding and play proceed clockwise. The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal rotates clockwise after each hand. The cards are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals 10 cards to each player and six face down in the middle of the table to form the kitty. The cards are usually dealt as follows: a batch of 3 to each player; two to the kitty; 4 to each player; two to the kitty; 3 to each player; two to the kitty.BiddingThe bidding begins with the player to dealer's left and continues clockwise. The possible bids are:1. a number of tricks (minimum six) and a trump suit - for example a bid of \"eight diamonds\" undertakes that the bidder, with partner's help, will try to win at least eight tricks with diamonds as trumps;2. a number (minimum six) of \"No Trumps\", (also known as \"No-ies\") offering to win at least that number of tricks without a trump suit;3. a game a trump suit or \"No Trumps\",A player who does not wish to bid can pass. If all four players pass the cards are thrown in.Once someone has bid, each subsequent bid must be higher than the previous one. Higher means either more tricks, or the same number of tricks in a higher suit. For this purpose No trumps are highest, followed by Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades (lowest). Thus the lowest possible bid is Six Spades and the highest is Ten No Trumps.Scoring each bidding :Nb tricks  6   7   8   9  10 GameSpades    40 140 240 340 440 1000Clubs     60 160 260 360 460 1000Diamonds  80 180 280 380 480 1000Hearts   100 200 300 400 500 1000No Trump 120 220 320 420 520 1000If the 4 players pass or the maximum bidding remains lower than 8, the cards are collected and distributed by the player having started to bidding.Take of kittyThe contractor begins by picking up the six cards of the kitty (without showing them to the other players), and discarding any 6 cards face down in their place. The cards discarded can include cards which were picked up from the kitty.Play of cardThe trump is determined by the kind of the strongest bidding. The player having made strongest bidding starts to play.He is obligatory to provide to the kind of the first played card. If a player does not have a card of the kind requested, it plays the card that it wants (Trump or not). Both Joker and the Small Jack are always regarded as being same kind of Trump.The player who gained the trick is that which starts to play the following turn.The order of the cards is as follows: (If the trump is Spades)  White Joker  Color Joker  Jack  Spade  (Jack Big)  Jack  Club   (Jack Small)  Ace   Spade  King  Spade  Queen Spade  ten   Spade  ...  four  SpadeThe other cards in Heart, Diamonds and Clubs are in the following order:  Ace   Heart  King  Heart  Queen Heart  Jack  Heart  ten   Heart  ...  four  HeartNote:   if Trump is Clubs the Small Jack is the Jack of Spades if Trump is Hearts the Small Jack is the Jack of Diamonds if Trump is Diamonds the Small Jack is the Jack of HeartsIn No Trump, the Jokers are regarded as of Trumps, and gains the trick where they are played, though it arrives.Calculate scoreTo gain our bidding, it is necessary to collect the same number of trick as one bidding. (Example: bidding 8 Spades, it is necessary to gain 8 tricks). If the attack team gains her bidding, it marks the number of corresponding points. If it loses its bidding then it is the other team which marks the number of corresponding points.The winner is the first team to reach 1000 points. When the game is bidding, it is necessary to gain the 10 tricks and it is the game which one gains or loses according to the result.

{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Werkforum+Kiel", "Description": " Crabby31, that\u2019s the card game Thirty-one or Big Tonka, Nickel Nock or Blitz as it is also called. This is the German variation of the game (Schwimmen). It can be played against up to eight computer players. Moreover you\u2019re able to see statistics about your wins. You get all that for free, without ads, and without permissions. Consequently the app does not access your personal data or the Internet. In-game help is provided.RULES OF THE GAME:Your goal is to score as many points as possible with a hand of three cards. In doing so, an ace counts eleven, king, queen and jack count 10, and the other cards count face value. You can add up the score of the single cards, if the cards are of the same suit. The highest score possible amounts to 31, which is called a \"blitz\". It can be achieved, for example, by an ace, a king and a ten of the same suit. Besides, three cards of the same rank (e. g. three jacks) count as a score of 30 \u00bd.At first, the dealer chooses to put her cards face-up on the table or to keep her cards. In the first case she gets new cards from the stack. In the second case she puts three new cards from the stack on the table.Then the game starts. The players take turns and have the following options:1) Discard one card to the table and pick up one card from the table (choose this option by touching both cards)2) Pick up all cards from the table and discard all player cards to the table (Button \"Swap all\")3) Do nothing (Button \"Pass\")4) \"Knock\". The other players have one more turn each and then the game ends.5) Take new cards from the stock and put them on the table (Button \"New cards\"), but only if there is a seven, an eight and a nine on the table. You have one more turn after choosing this option.If all players choose \"pass\", new cards are drawn from the stock to the table.The game ends immediately, if one player\u2019s score is 31 (blitz) or if one player holds three aces.Finally all players show their hands. The player with the lowest score loses the game. If more than one player have the same lowest score, each of them loses. But if one of the players with the lowest score has knocked, only this one loses the game. If one player holds 3 aces, all other players lose the game regardless of their score.At the start of a series every player has three tokens. If a player loses a game, she also loses a token. Only in the special case of two players playing the game and one of them having three aces, the loser of the game has to give up two tokens. When a player has lost all of her tokens, she continues to play on a \"free ride\". Losing again, she is eliminated from the series. The last remaining player in the series has won the series. If she still owns all three of her tokens, she has \"won with crown\".
