In our experience, comments on GooglePlay are not a good way for it due to the limitations of our answers (150 chars)  and the difficulties into contact with you again.---------------Q: Why is ONLINE? Why cannot be offline? R: Think of the app  as in Youtube. Each time you load a scene, this must be downloaded, then cached to accelerate the following times, but you'll still need internet connection (exactly as you see a video on youtube ).and no, there is no way to make this APP (or youtube) offline.The app can download and cache up to 1Gb.---------------P: In what languages is it translated? R: SPANISH (original language) and ENGLISH (translated).  French, Portuguese, Russian Italian...  have already been requested, we are considering the translation from those languages where  the users collaborate in its translation, since we do not speak these languages. More than 20.000 medical terms, plus the book's videos and descriptions should be translated.---------------Q: Why is there a Login button ? A: For students is NOT NECESSARY. If you are TEACHER, you can request a login account to create your own 3D books for your classes. Remember AnatomyLearning is available for PC and MAC, to use the app in classroom.----------------Q: Why are there some books in \"under construction\"? A: The project is still GROWING. We have modeling  some 3D anatomical parts, of which we have not created an adequate bibliography for learning. ----------------Q: What should I do if the app could not be installed, or it does not connect to the server? A: Follow these steps:  - - - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. - Make sure you fit requirements:  Android 4       . . . .     1Gb RAM     . . . .       1GB of free space to install apps.  - - -     2. - Connect a WIFI or 4G high speed connection. G and 3G connections are often inadequate, slow and tedious. The loading of pages with a good connection takes about  5 - 10 seconds. (Think you're going to download 5 to 10 MB for each 3D model).  - - -     3. - Install the APP, open it and access the Library.  - - -     4. - If, after have followed these steps, you still can not access, send us your error through our mail.

We strongly recommend you to use bug spray and mosquito nets in areas where malaria, dengue fewer and other diseases are present.Researchers have little divided views regarding the effect of sound to repel mosquitoes.\u2022 The ultrasonic Mosquito repellent application emit a very unique high frequency sound (ultra sound) to mimic the sound of male mosquito wing beats that most mosquitoes find distasteful and prevents you from getting bitten by mosquitoes.\u2022 Do you know that only female mosquitoes bite us? Do you also know that mosquitoes stay away from certain sonic frequencies?\u2022 The pitch of the sound is so high that most humans will not notice anything.* Mosquito bite can lead to malaria, dengue, fever, hey fever,allergy, chikangunya, repel mosquito, save life.\u2022 Green and Non-toxic!this Anti Mosquito app Keep mosquitoes away naturally, avoiding to breathe toxic gas and without environment pollution.\u2022 Tips:\u2022 Turn up the volume to the highest level for a more effective sound.\u2022 Use the Frequency controls to find the optimal repelling frequency for your region.The app does not guarantee a 100% protection as there are over 3500 known mosquito species in the world and they all react slightly different to the repellent. Use the Frequency selector to find optimal repelling frequency for the mosquitoes in your region.get More info about ultra sonic technique: http://www.ehow.com/list_7865665_frequencies-repel-insects.htmlFAQ:Q: After I switch on app,why Screen Brightness reduced ?A: Its completely NORMAL, the Brightness is reduced in order to SAVE BATTERY of your device.Q: How ultra sound repels Mosquitoes ?A:The theory is that only Female mosquitoes are able to bite us and once a female mosquito has her eggs fertilized she will actively avoid any further contact with the male. In order to to do this, she can recognize the sound of the vibrations from the wing beat of the male which it is claimed is sufficiently different from a females to enable this to happen \u2013 thus, upon recognizing such wingbeats the female is \u2018repelled\u2019 away so as to avoid any further and now unwanted attentions of the male.Q.: Why i'm hearing an hiss? / Why I don't hear nothing?A.: The app plays an high frequency sound. Some people under 30 years old can hear the sound, while over a certain age (variable from person to person) the ear lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds.Q.: Mosquitoes don't have ears, how do they hear sounds??A.: Insects don't have ears, but on feelers, that are the mosquitoes aural organs, there are about 15.000 sensorial receptors, structured so to create an \"active ear\" in which natural vibrations are generated so to amplify the incoming sounds. [Source: Le Scienze on-line]Q.: Are you telling me that the phone loudspeaker can play ultrasounds?A.: Actually the frequency used in Anti Mosquito is slightly under the ultrasounds threshold frequency. But it's very close to the limit that can be heard by the human ear (20 kHz), so for the sake of simplicity we called it \"ultrasound\", because a lot of people can't hear it.Q:why this app need  permissions ?A:1.permissions \"WRITE_SETTINGS\" :WRITE SETTINGS permission is needed to adjust the brightness of the screen in-order to SAVE BATTERY of device.2.permissions INTERNET & ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE etc:To display  ads this permissions are needed.we understand your privacy so we DONT spam, its not in our DNA.

As a result they are often simple and repetitive. Lullabies can be found in every culture and since the ancient period.Typically a lullaby is in triple metre, or in a compound metre like 6/8. Tonally, most lullabies are simple, often merely alternating tonic and dominant harmonies: Because the intended effect is to put someone to sleep, wild chromaticism would be somewhat out of character.Many Christmas carols are designed as lullabies for the infant Jesus, the most famous of them being \"Silent Night\".With baby sounds you will:\u2605 sleep like child (soothing music)\u2605 go to bed happy (white nois)\u2605 rest all day (lullaby)\u2605 slumber quickly (bedtime songs for kids)\u2605 be asleep soundly (relax melody)\u2605 kip all night (sounds of nature)\u2605 doss (meditation sounds)\u2605 roger (sleep songs)As tiny beings, babies require quite a few things the average human would need, but in smaller portions or in different wavelengths. For instance, sunlight\u2026it's not that the sun will kill a baby, but if exposed to more than a certain amount, it could be harmful to the child. So also music\u2026depending on the genre and volume, what a regular person may consider soothing or relaxing may actually be more than a child can handle.Lullabies are often sung by parents in calming children, putting them to sleep, or simply spending time with them. The simple lyrics, nature, and storyline of lullabies are usually intended for children, and are therefore suitable for them. A parent can rock a child to sleep with a lull-a-bye, calm a discontented child, or singalong with a playing child.

This easy to use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Guidelines, thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. NCCN invites you to explore the NCCN Guidelines in this exciting new format.The National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae), a not-for-profit alliance of 23 of the world's leading cancer centers, is dedicated to improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. As the arbiter of high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers. The primary goal of all NCCN initiatives is to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of oncology practice so patients can live better lives.Over the past 15 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes.The NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions for the malignant cancers that affect 97 percent of all patients with cancer. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas.The NCCN Guidelines are composed of recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived.  Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The goal of the NCCN Guidelines is to help oncologists make the major clinical decisions encountered in managing their patients by providing ready access to synthesized information. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations.

Due to the attention of the human eye and the eyelids appeared specialty beauty eyes and eyelids, which is the newer disciplines of ophthalmology and more sophisticated comprises everything that surrounds Bmqlh eye of the eyelids and muscles and glands and channels lacrimal and veins and arteries and bones of pilgrims around the eye. Has contributed to social development that the world has witnessed recently in making the shape of the eye and eyelids a key factor in the individual look for himself and those around him, and also as a result of technological development that has led to the tremendous development of means such as laser and injections to beautify the eyes and eyelids.

Electrocardiography is definitely not an \"easy\" subject of study but with a minimum effort you can acquire the basic informations to be able to detect a critical situation and alert the cardiologist. The electrocardiogram is a simple test, fast, painless, very low-cost, and can definitely save the life of a person. In Italy every year about 120,000 people are affected by myocardial infarction, of these, approximately 25 000 die before reaching the hospital. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is mainly made with the execution of the ECG. With \"ECG practical\" you can learn in a simple way the basic principles of electrocardiography, you can calculate your heart rate from the milliseconds or the number of squares between two RR, you can see several examples of ECG tracings, calculate the corrected QT interval, you can easily find the QRS axes or you can make your \"diagnosis\" simply by answering a few simple questions.Note: The app does not process the photos taken with the camera or loaded from the gallery to not affect their quality. Loading large images (> 4 mpx) can cause the application to crash, especially in phones with little memory. When taking a photo, choose a lower than 4-megapixel resolution, and shot from a close distance.Version \"Demo\"The \"Demo\" version has the same functionality as the normal one, the only limit is the number of openings (15) of the application.

{"title": "Atlas Ultrasound Anesthesia TR", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Mobile+Systems", "rating": "3.3142857551574707", "Description": " Atlas of Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia, by Andrew T. Gray, MD, PhD, shows you how to get the maximum benefit from this technique, while at the same time increasing your efficiency and ensuring patient safety. Dr. Gray, a pioneer of ultrasound guidance in regional anesthesia, demonstrates step-by-step a full range of nerve block techniques designed to help you improve the quality and success rate of regional blocks.* Presents coverage of each block through a consistent organization that makes it easy to locate the information you need and allows for better learning.* Offers review-style questions that test your knowledge and competence and offer an excellent tool for ABA board exam preparation.* Includes more than 400 figures for visualization of the nerves and surrounding structures.* Helpful hints, including information on pronunciationAs the title states, this is an atlas of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia with abundant, well-annotated images.*This is a fully functional trial*Purpose: It is intended to serve as a reference and teaching resource. This is a desperate need for many practitioners, and this book is likely to become the gold standard, bedside reference.Audience: The audience is anyone who might perform the blocks it so beautifully illustrates, including anesthesia residents, pain fellows, and attending-level practitioners in both private practice and academia. While it might be useful for teaching students rotating through anesthesia, the book is clearly targeted at those who perform these blocks.Features: It includes a brief review of the physics of capturing ultrasound images, as well as some very practical and useful chapters about the application of ultrasound in the performance of regional anesthesia (e.g. chapters on approach techniques and sonographic signs of successful injections). The images are vastly better than most practitioners can obtain, and are richly and effectively annotated. It reads easily, as any useful bedside/clinical atlas should. Wisely, the author has avoided talking about drugs, volumes, and dosages, information which is reasonable to expect practitioners to know or obtain from other resources.Assessment: If you practice ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, you are likely to find this an invaluable bedside resource. If you teach ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, you will find this an indispensable reference. It is large enough to be really useful, yet light/small enough to be very portable. I anticipate that it will become a must-have addition to most anesthesia libraries, and that copies will find their way to most places where regional anesthesia is performed.

By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life. Over the last 40 years, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research. Today, the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms.Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which genetic information encoded in DNA is able to result in the processes of life. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used, molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology.Main Features:1.

Symptoms start two days to three weeks after contracting the virus, with a fever, sore throat, muscle pain and headaches. Typically, vomiting, diarrhea and rash follow, along with decreased functioning of the liver and kidneys. Around this time, affected people may begin to bleed both within the body and externally.[1]The virus may be acquired upon contact with blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal.[1] Spreading through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.[2] Fruit bats are believed to carry and spread the virus without being affected. Once human infection occurs, the disease may spread between people, as well. Male survivors may be able to transmit the disease via semen for nearly two months. To make the diagnosis, typically other diseases with similar symptoms such as malaria, cholera and other viral hemorrhagic fevers are first excluded. To confirm the diagnosis, blood samples are tested for viral antiboies, viral RNA, or the virus itself.Prevention includes decreasing the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by checking such animals for infection and killing and properly disposing of the bodies if the disease is discovered. Properly cooking meat and wearing protective clothing when handling meat may also be helpful, as are wearing protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. Samples of bodily fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution.[1]No specific treatment for the disease is yet available.[1] Efforts to help those who are infected are supportive and include giving either oral rehydration therapy (slightly sweet and salty water to drink) or intravenous fluids.[1] The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 50% and 90% of those infected with the virus.[1][3] EVD was first identified in Sudan (now South Sudan) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The disease typically occurs in outbreaks in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa.[1] From 1976 (when it was first identified) through 2013, the World Health Organization reported a total of 1,716 cases.[1][4] The largest outbreak to date is the ongoing 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak, which is affecting Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.[5][6] As of 22nd August 2014, 2,615 suspected cases resulting in the deaths of 1,427 have been reported.[7] Efforts are under way to develop a vaccine; however, none yet exists.[1]ebola un us symptoms news 2014 what is  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebola_evd_ehf_english.ebola_evd_ehf_english", "price": "0", "date_published": "September 19, 2014", "email": "1016893655sspba@gmail.com", "downloads": "1,000 - 5,000", "category": "Medical", "developer": "MP WP & ANDROID", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/site/aplicativosparasmartphone/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFoYmKQu8VQ13KOkDKa1lbcuqFJZw", "reviewers": "21"}

Certainly, but English is not my native language ;)/!\\@Matthew, you're absolutely right, I try to find time to make this small change but it is not easy. Change the unit without going through the menu and allow to set \"feet & inches\" is the ultimate goal to eliminate all problems. I'm totally zen ;)This app is a \"Body Mass Index Calculator\".BMI cannot be accurate for \"athletes\" or \"muscular persons\" ! It's written bellow, in the description of this app ! >>> \"The result is valid for \"normal\" children/adults/m/f (but not for the muscular persons or \"athletes\"). The BMI formula is UNIQUE, for everybody. Why there is no GENDER and AGE ?! Again, it's written at the end of the description.**** The only thing that differs between adults and children is the \"reading table\". I give you a \"general reading table\" for ADULTS ONLY (Health Organizations did this, not me) ! The reading tables may differ between country or population (but really not so much... even if they exists). There is a more precise reading table for children 5/19 years made by WHO (World Health Organization : www.who.int). The general reading table is just an INDICATION. If you want some \"real\" information about your condition, ask your doctor ***My current BMI is 24.81, 1kg more and OMAGAD I'm in \"overweight\". And what ? I lift some weights, I run, I'm relatively muscled so there is nonsense to calculate my BMI. If you do sport, if you are in god shape, why do you want criticize a tool who isn't made for you ?If you start doing some sport, you can use this application to calculate your \"first\" BMI. When you begin to lose fat and gain muscle, you (maybe) will arrive in the \"normal\" zone. From there, if you continue to lose fat without gaining too much muscle, you can still calculate your BMI, the reading table will remain accurate for you. By cons, if you keep gaining muscle (AND/OR losing fat), from a certain point, calculate your BMI has absolutely no sense.Features:* Units: metric(cm - kg)/imperial(lbs - inches) (Use the menu button for changing that)* Languages: English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Croatian, Korean* Long click on the result's zone to resetFOR CHANGING UNITS, USE THE MENU BUTTON!---THE PROVIDED READING TABLE IS A \"GENERAL\" READING TABLE.HOWEVER, IT APPLIES WITHOUT DISTINCTION TO (ADULTS) - MEN AND WOMEN -. YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY IN OVERWEIGHT IF YOU EXCEED THE AVERAGE HIGH MORE THAN 0.1.SO BEFORE YOU SAY \"NOT ENOUGH FOR PRECISION\" THINK ABOUT THAT.HOWEVER IF YOU EXCEED 1 OR MORE OF THE \"NORMAL\" SLICE, THE READING TABLE WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF ITS ACCURACY.BMI IS A SIMPLE \"NUMBER\". IT IS USED WITH OTHER TOOLS FOR SHAPING A PROFILE OF HEALTH.Again, THIS APPLICATION IS A SIMPLE CALCULATOR. ONLY A DOCTOR WITH YOUR HISTORY OF HEALTH, YOUR BMI, ETC.

It provides emergency rooms, pharmacies and EMS with clinical content and tracking features that eliminate math and extra steps in drug administration and acute care. This improves medication safety, reduces the cost of care, and improves clinical outcomes. *SafeDose no longer provides all of eBroselow's medication content for free (a lot is still free but, sadly, the company couldn't provide it all free forever).  We rely on subscriptions to our Artemis web-based reference tool to support ourselves.  If your hospital subscribes to Artemis, enter your hospital's Artemis ID on the app's registration screen.  If you don't subscribe to Artemis, you can learn more and contact us from the eBroselow web site.*In an emergency setting, proper drug mixing and dilution, proper drug administration and proper dose in mL to a patient is critically time-sensitive. SafeDose provides the correct clinical information for hundreds of acute care and other drugs in seconds. First responders and EMS staff can use SafeDose to log patient status, drug administrations and caregiver actions. The SafeDose \u201cphoto feature\u201d can record time-stamped pictures of the patient, instrument settings and accident scene. SafeDose gives Nurses the exact dose in mL to avoid the ten-fold dosing errors that can lead to \"death by decimal point.\" Doctors can use SafeDose to order medications and send administration instructions to nurses and pharmacists. SafeDose creates a tidy PDF document that can be emailed as an order or prescription. Pharmacists get precise mixing instructions and can receive emailed PDF orders from doctors. This is a much safer and more efficient process than handwriting and paper. An amazing new \u201cNDC number and barcode scanning feature\u201d allows nurses and pharmacists to quickly enter the NDC number for any drug with an FDA NDC number on it (all drugs in the US). Entering this number, taking a picture of the barcode with the mobile device\u2019s camera, or scanning the barcode label with a Bluetooth scanner immediately brings up the dose in mL. iMedicalApps said SafeDose is \"useful and well designed... Undoubtedly, the potential for medication errors would be reduced if practitioners were to rely on the information provided by this app\". All SafeDose medical content is peer-reviewed for accuracy through the Artemis Initiative. A joint effort of eBroselow and the Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy Group (PPAG), the Artemis Initiative is an international standard for pediatric doses. PPAG consists of over 800 pediatric pharmacists from throughout the world.

Multiple related images comprise a series, which allows for scrolling through the image stack. These image series form the building blocks for Cases (related series demonstrating the imaging findings for a specific diagnosis in one particular patient), Teaching Files (topics organized in chapters and sub-chapters like a text book), and Tests (linked questions with associated image series). Cases can be grouped together in to Case Packs, which take only seconds to create, and are perfect for last minute unknown case presentations and focused studying.With RADIANT, you can create cases showing x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI, or any other imaging modality. It is a great way to learn chest x-rays, normal anatomy, and common disease processes, using real, high-quality diagnostic medical images.Share only what you want to share - your content remains yours and completely private unless you specifically share it with others.With a subscription, store your own personal library of images and associated content in the cloud, accessible from any Android device you own.Coming soon:   - Pass control to the audience: Connect your device to the projector, but allow an audience member to scroll the image stack from a different device!   - Poll the audience: Distribute an image to other users on a shared network connection and ask them to touch the abnormality. Display the touched locations on the projected screen to see the distribution of answers!   - Sell your own content on the built-in marketplace.

Each slice has neuroanatomical regions mapped out so that you can familiarise yourself with nuclei and tracts of the brain and spinal cord. I hope that NeuroSlice will be useful to training neurologists, neurosurgeons, medical students, and neuroscience students.This is the very first release; if you have any problems with this app, please email me and I'll try and fix it in the update!Neuroscan comprises 40 images taken from MRI scans and stained brain sections, which have been digitally labeled with the anatomical regions. They are all downloaded in the 6MB so you can browse offline.The program allows you to  1) touch a region to highlight it, and its name will be displayed 2) select the name of a region, and the region will be highlighted 3) search the database of regions to show which slices a given locus is visible.Most regions also have a short description, explaining the significance of the region. and can link out to Wikipedia if you have an internet connection. Finally, there is a testing-mode (beta) in which you can test yourself in one of two ways. Either you have to touch the region whose name is shown, or you have to select the name of the region which is highlighted. The software is written by Sanjay Manohar ( http://www.smanohar.com ) who also wrote the HOM physiology simulator in collaboration with Roger Carpenter (http://www.homphysiology.org).

The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.In the test, you are given objects with low contrast. You should identify the object if possible.

It was named after its designer, Dr. Shinobu Ishihara. The test consists of a number of colored plates, called Ishihara plates, each of which contains a circle of dots appearing randomized in color and size. Within the pattern are dots which form a number or shape clearly visible to those with normal color vision, and invisible, or difficult to see, to those with a red-green color vision defect, or the other way around. The seemingly random colored dots are arranged in such a fashion that a person with normal color vision will see a single-digit or two-digit number within the array of dots, while a colorblind person will either be unable to see a number or will see a different number than the one seen by a person with normal color vision.   A color blind test should be given to anyone considering a profession where accurate color perception is essential. Examples include car driver, electricians, commercial artists, designers, technicians, and certain manufacturing and marketing personnel.

The meteorologically assigned cloud type associated with the thunderstorm is the cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or no precipitation at all. Those that cause hail to fall are called hailstorms. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms may rotate, known as supercells. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then precipitated\u2014that is, become heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystem, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness, relatively suspended sensory activity, and inactivity of nearly all voluntary muscles. It is distinguished from quiet wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, and is more easily reversible than being in hibernation or a coma. Sleep is a heightened anabolic state, accentuating the growth and rejuvenation of the immune, nervous, skeletal and muscular systems. It is observed in all mammals, all birds, and many reptiles, amphibians, and fish.Meditation is a practice in which an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or as an end in itself.

{"title": "Sleep Tight Night Light", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Colorwork+Apps", "rating": "3.845132827758789", "Description": " Sleep Tight Night Light has many features to help you sleep at night.  In addition to a night light that allows you to choose any color that you can imagine, Sleep Tight Night Light has a white noise sound machine, digital and analog clocks, an alarm clock, and it displays the current weather and the weather forecast in three hour increments \u2013 perfect to help you start your day off right.Here are more details about the features of Sleep Tight Night Light:WHITE NOISE SOUND MACHINE:Turn the white noise sound machine on and off using the Sound Icon (Row 1 on Left).  You can choose several ambient noise sounds including Pure White Noise, Rain, Thunderstorm, Waves, and a Slow Heartbeat.  Each sound has been carefully looped for perfect gapless playback.  The white noise sounds will continue to play when you turn on the night light, or if you turn off your screen.  The sounds will stop when you turn off the Sound Icon or close out of the app.  The slider bar allows you to control the white noise volume relative to the alarm volume.ALARM CLOCK:Turn the alarm clock on or off using the Alarm Clock Icon (Row 2 on Left).  Touch the time to choose the alarm time.  The small play button allows you to preview the alarm sounds, which include your phones default alarm, a Spanish Guitar tune, or a beautiful Piano Lullaby.  Be sure that the app\u2019s volume is not on mute.  The alarm will sound and turn on the night light even if you close the app or your phone is off.  NIGHT LIGHT: Turn the night light on by pressing the Night Light Icon (Row 3 on Left).  Change or set your night light color by touching the large colored rectangle.  You can literally choose from any available color \u2013 red, orange, yellow, blue, green, indigo, or violet, and everything in between.  The brightness of the night light can be set using your phones brightness settings.The night light will quickly drain your battery if not plugged in.  The night light\u2019s sleep timer is off by default.  Set the sleep timer to 15, 30, or 60 minutes to turn off your screen after the specified time.  The sleep timer does not affect the white noise sound machine or alarm clock, so both will continue to function as expected.  There are two separate options for clocks \u2013 both analog and digital.  Turning one or both of those clocks on will display a clock on the night light screen.  Touch the night light or press the back button to turn off the night light and return to the main screen.WEATHER:Want to know what to wear in the morning?  When your alarm goes off or you return to the main screen, the weather will update with the current weather and temperature.

Numerous literature sources have been used in preparing the guidelines. For many drugs, including newly-approved medications, investigational agents and medications available in other countries, there have been no dialysis pharmacokinetic studies. In some cases, the available data may conflict. Conditions of dialysis used in published studies may not reflect current dialysis practice and technology. Variations in the duration of dialysis, blood and dialysate flow rates, dialysis membranes, and whether peritoneal dialysis is continuous or intermittent, will all affect drug removal. These guidelines distinguish between conventional hemodialysis and high permeability (high-flux) hemodialysis where such data are available.

{"title": "Glasgow Coma Scale Free", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Copanonga", "rating": "4.259912014007568", "Description": " The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS is a neurological scale that aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. A patient is assessed against the criteria of the scale, and the resulting points give a patient score between 3 (indicating deep unconsciousness) and either 14 (original scale) or 15 (the more widely used modified or revised scale).GCS was initially used to assess level of consciousness after head injury, and the scale is now used by first aid, EMS, and doctors as being applicable to all acute medical and trauma patients. In hospitals it is also used in monitoring chronic patients in intensive care.The scale was published in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J. Jennett, professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow's Institute of Neurological Sciences at the city's Southern General Hospital.GCS is used as part of several ICU scoring systems, including APACHE II, SAPS II, and SOFA, to assess the status of the central nervous system. A similar scale, the Rancho Los Amigos Scale is used to assess the recovery of traumatic brain injury patients.Languages:\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629Catal\u00e0\u010ceskyDanskDeutschEnglishEspa\u00f1olSuomiFran\u00e7aisHrvatskiItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9eNederlands\u202anorsk (bokm\u00e5l)\u202cPolskiPortugu\u00eas\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439Srpskohrvatski / \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438Svenska\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22T\u00fcrk\u00e7eTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\u4e2d\u6587  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.copanonga.glasgowfree", "price": "0", "date_published": "August 25, 2012", "email": "copanonga@gmail.com", "downloads": "100,000 - 500,000", "category": "Medical", "developer": "Copanonga", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://copanonga.es&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNE2uR2LZHWDwk4gsFIXLhAEYiroyQ", "reviewers": "454"}

It supports English, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Italian and Norwegian.Acupressure is an ancient healing art that uses the fingers to press key points on the surface of the skin to stimulate the body's natural self-curative abilities. When these points are pressed, they release muscular tension and promote the circulation of blood and the body's life force to aid healing.Foremost among the advantages of acupressure's healing touch is that it is safe to do on yourself and others - even if you've never done it before. You can also use self-acupressure to relieve anxiety and to help you get to sleep at night.App contains over 90 points combinations to be used in different situations e.g. to relief the headache, to give up smoking, to reduce high blood pressure etc. All the combinations are present in the following groups:\u2022Maintaining health;\u2022Emergencies;\u2022Stop addictions;\u2022Pain relief;\u2022Sense organs disorders;\u2022Circulatory disorders;\u2022Digestive disorders;\u2022Respiratory disorders;\u2022Urinary disorders;\u2022Reproductive disorders;\u2022Other common disorders.

{"title": "Respiroguide Pro", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Vital-EQ", "rating": "3.7413792610168457", "Description": " RESPIROGUIDE PRO: THE NEWEST VERSION, MORE PERSONAL\u201cSimple and amazingly effective for better concentration, stress anxiety, ADHD and trauma healing\u201d \u2013 Kees L. Blase, medical physicist, National Centre for Stress Management,The Netherlands.Respiroguide PRO is brought to you by Vital-EQ the International Institute for Stress Management.**********THE ABC of STRESSMANAGEMENTRespiroguide uses the most recent research in neurosciences and stress management, research that has been condensed into the most convenient one-touch tool. The knowledge is based on the heart's resonant frequency which induces heart and breath coherence.Respiroguide Pro will train the reflexes and so the elasticity of your vascular system. This will help in lowering blood pressure, is effective in coping with stress and anxiety, and enhances better concentration at school and work.Heart rate is a dynamic body function that varies in each moment.In an Active state (sympathic activity) heart rate increases,in a Calm and relaxed state heart rate decreases.Cardiac Coherence is the Balanced state of the autonomic nervous system in which you feel safe and happy, free from fear and anxiety and overstressed reactions.The body can be brought into the state of Cardiac Coherence through guided breathing. Guiding the resonance frequency (Respiroguide Pro) can be compared with guiding someone on a swing by pushing at just the right moment to optimise their swing.Each individual has his or her own personal respiratory frequency (resonance frequency) in which cardiac coherence is optimal. This ideal respiratory frequency is between 0,06 Hz and 0,12 Hz. The Respiroguide Pro will help you to find your personal resonance frequency, which depends on the length and width of your blood vessels.You can set the guide in four different frequencies:1. Average: F6: 6 breaths a minute = 0,1 Hz2. Average: F5: 5 breaths a minute = 0,083 Hz3. Slow: F4: 4 breaths a minute = 0,066 Hz4. Quick: F7: 7 breaths a minute = 0,118 HzTo find your resonance frequency it\u2019s important to experience all four breathing frequencies and notice:-which one provides the most balanced feeling-which one can be comfortably sustained for a period of at least 5 minutes-which one gives a maximum amplitude in Heart Rate Variability. This last function requires access to a HRV-biofeedback instrument with a Cardiac Coherence Coach.Cardiac Coherence Coaches can be found at www.hartfocus.nl (Netherlands) and www.heartintelligence.com/VitalEQ (Europe, Asea).The Respiroguide Pro is a medical tested safe device. More than 20 years of research showed positive effects:lowering bloodpressure, less anxiety, enhancing performance, coping with stress, effective treatment of trauma.Take care: do not inhale too deeply, this occasionally make you dizzy. Focusing on the exhale is the most effective way.QUICK START: press the play button and just breathe in and out with the yellow dot. Breathe in as the dot goes up, breathe out as it goes down.The default setting is a 3 minute long exercise. This is what it takes to lower your level of stress.You can gradually increase the exercise lengths, but remember to exercise three times every day. Over one week of exercising you will notice the effects in your body.Probably the best investment you will ever make. If you use it!Other options:1. Turn the sea wave sounds on and off (the waves are synchronized to the specific 0,1Hz frequency)2. Choose the duration of the exercise; remember that the secret to stress relief is practicing several times every day, so make it simple, use the Respiroguide!For details access the following websites:- www.heartintelligence.com in English- www.nuvitaal.nu and www.hartfocus.nl in Dutch- www.emnergie.com in French************We do appreciate your feedback!Vital-EQ, the International Institute for Stress Management.

Hiermee onderscheidt de Koolhydraatkenner zich van veel andere koolhydratentabellen.Bij diabetes bestaat de behandeling steeds meer uit een combinatie van kennis en technologie.  Goed en succesvol gebruik van bijvoorbeeld een insulinepomp vereist ook goede kennis van koolhydraten. De Koolhydraatkenner is een uitkomst omdat daarmee die kennis snel en goed kan worden opgezocht. En goede koolhydraatkennis wordt nog belangrijker nu de insulinepomp gekoppeld kan worden aan de sensor die continue de bloedsuikerwaarde meet.de Koolhydraatkenner is ontwikkeld in samenwerking met de artsen en dietisten van Diabeter, het nationaal kenniscentrum voor Diabetes.De Koolhydraatkenner geeft voor meer dan 1000 producten de hoeveelheid koolhydraten (gram) per hoeveelheid. De eenheid waarin deze hoeveelheid is gegeven verschilt per product. Zo bevat een glas appelsap 12 gram koolhydraten. E\u00e9n stuk baklava (van 30 gram) bevat 16 gram koolhydraten. Deze waardes zijn geverifieerd door erkende artsen en dietisten. Koolhydraten tellen: producten kunnen worden gebundeld tot een zogenaamd eetmoment. Per eetmoment wordt de totale hoeveelheid koolhydraten geteld. Deze eetmomenten worden bewaard en kunnen later weer worden opgezocht.Verder kunt u op eenvoudige wijze de uitgebreide lijst producten verder uitbreiden met 'eigen' producten. Deze 'eigen' producten worden in de standaard lijst opgenomen. Alle beschikbare functies zijn ook op deze producten van toepassing.Tevens beschikt de Koolhydraatkenner over een aantal handige vuistregels waarmee heel snel de hoeveelheid koolhydraten uitgerekend kan worden van een apart lijstje met producten.

This distinguishes the Carbohydrate Kenner from many other carbohydrates tables.In diabetes treatment increasingly composed of a combination of knowledge and technology. Good and successful use of an insulin pump for example, also requires good knowledge of carbohydrates. The Carbohydrate Kenner is a godsend because this knowledge quickly and properly can be searched. And good carbohydrate knowledge is even more important now that the insulin pump can be attached to the sensor that continuously measures the blood sugar linked.The Carbohydrate Kenner was developed in collaboration with doctors and dieticians Diabeter of the national knowledge center for Diabetes.The Carbohydrate Kenner cares for more than 1000 products, the amount of carbohydrates (grams) per volume. The unit in which the quantity is given to each product. For example, a glass of apple juice 12 grams of carbohydrates. One piece of baklava (30 grams) contains 16 grams of carbohydrates. These values \u200b\u200bare verified by licensed doctors and dieticians.Carbohydrate counting: products can be bundled into a so-called eetmoment. Per eetmoment the total amount of carbohydrate is counted. These eating occasions are stored and can be retrieved later.You can expand a simple manner the extensive list of products with \"own\" products. These 'own' products are included in the standard list.

The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world\u2019s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!Blood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret\u2014even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.You start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end.

A multitude of factors influence the rate of each baby\u2019s individual growth such as genetics, form of delivery, gestation at delivery, medical issues, effectiveness of the placenta prior to delivery, and so on. However there is a persistent and understandable demand from first-time mothers for information on what is considered \u2018the norm\u2019. This is particularly so with breastfeeding, as understanding breastmilk intake is more complex than looking at the oz mark on a bottle. This is a topic rife with large-scale confusion, especially as breastfeeding mothers are in the minority and can often find themselves, and their health workers, comparing their baby with formula-fed babies. Breastfed babies are not the same as formula fed babies. One is fed the milk of its own species; the other is fed the milk of an entirely different species, so it is unsurprising that stark differences can be observed. What follows is a timeline detailing the journey of the average breastfed baby.I hope it will prove to be a useful and reassuring tool for new mothers.

Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: Facts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. Imaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. Classification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. Treatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. Simply select the bone or joint you\u2019re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen.

L\u2019elettrocardiogramma \u00e8 un esame semplice, veloce, assolutamente indolore, di bassissimo costo, e pu\u00f2 decisamente salvare la vita di una persona. In Italia ogni anno circa 120.000 persone vengono colpite da infarto miocardico, di queste, circa 25 mila muoiono prima di arrivare in ospedale. La diagnosi di infarto miocardico viene fatta prevalentemente con l\u2019esecuzione dell\u2019ECG.Con \"ECG pratico\" potete apprendere in maniera semplice i principi base dell'elettrocardiografia, potete calcolare la frequenza cardiaca a partire dai millisecondi o dal numero di quadrati fra due RR, potete vedere diversi esempi di tracciati ecg, calcolare l'intervallo QT corretto, trovare l'asse QRS del vostro ecg oppure potete fare la vostra \"diagnosi\" semplicemente rispondendo ad alcune semplici domande.Nota: L'app non elabora le foto scattate con la fotocamera o caricate dalla galleria per non pregiudicare la loro qualit\u00e0. Caricare immagini di grosse dimensioni (>4 mpx) pu\u00f2 provocare il crash dell'applicazione, specialmente in telefoni con poca memoria. Se riscontrate problemi del genere, scegliete una risoluzione inferiore a 4 mpx, e scattate da una distanza ravvicinata.Versione \"Demo\".La versione \u201cDemo\u201d ha le stesse funzionalit\u00e0 di quella normale, l\u2019unico limite \u00e8 nel numero di aperture dell\u2019applicazione stessa. Non ho voluto mettere il solito limite temporale (num massimo di giorni) perch\u00e9 a me stesso \u00e8 capitato di aver installato app da provare per un certo periodo di tempo, ma per motivi di lavoro e impegni famigliari non ho potuto provarle sufficientemente prima della scadenza. Il presente software NON DEVE assolutamente essere usato per porre una qualsiasi diagnosi medica e/oinfermieristica,  ma deve essere usato esclusivamente a scopo didattico.Prima di acquistare la versione completa (questa), provate la versione \u201cdemo\u201d del prodotto.

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made mainly with the execution of the ECG.With \"ECG practical\" you can learn the basics in a simple electrocardiography, you can calculate your heart rate from the milliseconds or the number of squares between two RR, you can see several examples of ECG tracings, calculate the corrected QT interval, find the axis of the QRS your ecg or you can make your \"diagnosis\" simply by answering a few simple questions.Note: The app does not process the photos taken with the camera or loaded from the gallery not to adversely affect their quality. Load large images (> 4 mpx) can cause the application to crash, especially in low-memory phones. If you encounter such problems, choose a lower resolution 4-megapixel, and taken from a close distance.Version \"Demo\".The version of \"Demo\" has the same features as the normal one, the only limit is the number of openings of the application. I did not want to put the usual time limit (num Maximum days) because I happened to have the same app installed to try it for a certain period of time, but for reasons of work and family commitments I could not try them sufficiently before the deadline.This software absolutely MUST NOT be used to bring any medical diagnosis and / ornursing, but must be used for educational purposes only.Before you buy the full version (this one), try the \"demo\" version of the product. If you remain satisfied after trying it, buy the full version and support the further development of the application.For bug reports, comments and suggestions please email: kapelis95@gmail.comReviewed by tuttoandroid.net  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ecg.pratico", "price": "EGP14.81", "date_published": "August 24, 2014", "email": "kapelis95@gmail.com", "downloads": "100 - 500", "category": "Medical", "developer": "Kapelis", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "1.6 and up", "reviewers": "14"}

According to research conducted in ADHD, regular cognitive training can improve core symptoms of ADHD.The Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Trainer is a cognitive training application designed for children with ADHD. The ADHD Trainer is adapted from another cognitive training technique; The TCT Method (Tajima Cognitive Training), which was developed by Dr. Kazuhiro Tajima-Pozo, an expert psychiatrist in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.   The TCT Method is a daily cognitive training therapy that entails multiple cognitive tasks. The TCT Method trains cognitive areas such as attention, memory, calculation, reasoning, and visuomotor coordination. The poor completion rate of cognitive training therapies presents a major hurdle to treat cognitive deficits in children with ADHD. Children with ADHD often evidence a lack of motivation, as exhibited through avoidance of tasks requiring mental effort.Unlike many other cognitive training therapies, The TCT Method attempts to \"entertain,\" while challenging cognitive training is performed, creating an optimal level of motivation for children with ADHD.The TCT Method of cognitive training entails children to play \u201cgames\u201d for 70 minutes per week or 280 minutes per month.

Additional exams can be added with an in-app purchase by clicking on the \"lock\" symbols over the exams on the home screen.App Features:National Registry Level QuestionsThe questions featured in the NREMT Simulator were designed and edited by the same people who author questions for the National Registry database, following the same strict guidelines, format and exacting standards of The National Registry. With questions spanning the entire scope of the National EMT Curriculum, you will find no better resource to show you what it feels like to take this test. No other study guide can claim that their material has been through the rigorous review process that our 120 questions have. Properly Calibrated DifficultyThe Registry doesn't score you based on how many questions you answer correctly, they score you based on the difficulty level of the questions you answer correctly. The simulator uses test questions calibrated just above the minimum passing level of the National Registry Exam. That means that you can get real feedback about your ability to pass on test day.Actual Test ResultsOnce you've finished the exam, you'll get real results in a similar format to the actual Registry results page. Your results gauge your success in each of the six major categories of the Registry exam, using the same Above Passing / Near Passing / Below Passing results that the NREMT uses. Then you'll get a report detailing information for future study. The NREMT Simulator doesn't just help you study. It does what no other app on the market can do. It tells you if you're ready to pass.Timed TestingGet a true sense of your personal testing cadence. Our market research indicated that the running clock was one of the most intimidating elements of the National Registry test. The simulator lets you experience that pressure before test day so you won't feel quite so stressed on testing day.Take the exam before you have to take the exam with the NREMT Simulator.

Material und Methoden: Im Laufe eines Jahres wurden die wichtigsten Standardeinstellungen und Spezialaufnahmen der Skelettradiographie junger, gesunder Erwachsener gesammelt und nach fach\u00e4rztlicher Begutachtung f\u00fcr die Orthorad-Datenbank freigegeben. Am Workflow von MTRAs und \u00c4rzten orientiert, wurde das gesammelte Bildmaterial, geordnet nach K\u00f6rperregionen, unter Orthorad organisiert. W\u00e4hrend den MTRAs u. a. Informationen zu Lagerung und Kassettenformat zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen, erh\u00e4lt der Arzt wichtige Informationen zur R\u00f6ntgenanatomie, Referenzdaten zum menschlichen Skelett und Hinweise zu h\u00e4ufigen traumatologischen und orthop\u00e4dischen Krankheitsbildern.Ergebnisse und Schlussfolgerung: Orthorad dient als Offline-Referenz(bild)datenbank f\u00fcr Skelettradiographie sowohl MTRAs als auch \u00c4rzten in der t\u00e4glichen Routine.

{"title": "Easy ECG", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Omnimedic+Solutions", "rating": "3.5999999046325684", "Description": " This app is so simple that it will allow someone with NO cardiology training whatsoever to interpret ECG rhythms in Lead 2 with 99% accuracy. Easy ECG is a simple, user-friendly application that helps the user interpret cardiac rhythms in Lead 2 by having the user answer a series of simple questions based on the presence, absence, or measurement of various characteristics on a patient\u2019s ECG printout. While all possible rhythms are not included, 40 of the most common rhythms seen by pre-hospital providers are included, and can be identified by answering less than 10 yes or no questions. While it is intended for case review or studying, EasyECG is written to be easy enough to allow someone with no ECG training to interpret an ECG rhythm. Other ECG apps out there were written by physicians and go into cardiologist-level detail in interpreting ECGs. EasyECG was written by a practicing street paramedic for EMTs, paramedics, nurses, firefighters, residents, and students of all levels to have a simple, quick, easy to use interface for interpretation. This app does not include sample rhythms for interpretation, as that is not its purpose; the purpose is to help the user correctly interpret an ECG rhythm. DIRECTIONS: Examine the Lead 2 tracing of a patient\u2019s ECG, and answer questions in the app based on what is seen on the patient\u2019s ECG printout. In some cases, a sample ECG complex with the characteristic in question highlighted in green will appear under the question to clarify what is being asked (not every question has a sample image, only certain questions). All questions have an info button if additional clarification is needed, and the info button on the final rhythm determination gives a description of what is occurring in the electrical conduction system of heart to cause that rhythm. A definitions list is accessible from the main menu that explains the physiology behind each rhythm included and explains what is occurring in the heart with each wave in an ECG tracing.

{"title": "FHR 5-Tier", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=OB+APPS+LLC", "rating": "5", "Description": " This app is intended for obstetricians, midwives, and nurses who use electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in laboring patients. In addition to interpreting fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings, health care professionals must communicate with each other about the tracings in a way that is understood by all parties, and decide what action to take. FHR 5-tier is based on the five-color system developed by Drs. Julian Parer and Tomoaki Ikeda. (AJOG July 2007) The intent of their system is to standardize management of different fetal heart rate tracings. The system divides all fetal heart rate tracings into one of five categories: Green (no acidemia, no intervention required), Blue, Yellow, Orange or Red (evidence of actual or impending fetal asphyxia, rapid delivery recommended). Each color has assigned to it a: a) risk of acidemia, b) risk of evolution to a more serious pattern and c) recommended action. The NICHD three-tier system of classifying fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings has been criticized for having too wide a range of tracings in \u201cCategory II\u201d. Some researchers and clinicians believe that the five-tier color-coded system more effectively classifies EFM tracings. The five-tier system is being adopted by an increasing number of hospitals in the U.S. and in Japan. FHR 5-tier makes it easier to use the five-color system. Without the FHR 5-tier app, one must refer to a table with 134 possible combinations of variability, baseline, and decelerations. One must also either memorize or refer to the definitions for mild, moderate and severe decelerations, which are complex and sometimes confusing. When using the FHR 5-tier app it is not necessary to refer to any other table or chart. Variability and baseline, and the shape, nadir, and duration of decelerations are entered with buttons on the consecutive screens. The app calculates the severity of the deceleration and the color for each tracing. All aspects of the tracing are summarized on the colored results screen, so that the user can quickly communicate with others. Management recommendations as outlined by Parer and Ikeda are given. These include whether or not the obstetrician needs to be at the bedside; what other personnel should be available; and whether the patient should be moved to the operating room. In addition, conservative management techniques are listed where appropriate. Thus, for Blue, Yellow, and Orange tracings, the final results screen reminds the user to consider actions such as maternal position change, decreasing oxytocin, or amnioinfusion. As noted by Parer and Ikeda, the guidelines for management may need to be modified for institutions other then theirs, and may even change depending on time of day. The NICHD Category (I, II, III) is also given on the results screen. This application is intended as a reference tool for use only by licensed healthcare professionals. This application is not a substitute for each licensed healthcare professional's independent clinical judgment. No medical decision should be based solely on information obtained by use of this tool.

The data has been collected and processed by two university academics, who used 3D reconstruction techniques to allow the external and internal structures of the teeth to be explored in 3D in great detail. The app also contains a guide to the morphology and features of the teeth, with 3D demonstrations of how they relate to the tooth in question. A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide.This is the perfect tool for Dentists, Dental students and anyone else wishing to learn the medical structure of the teeth and mouth. The high detail and resolution available when viewing an individual tooth, including the internal structures, allows many interesting features of the teeth to be seen and understood.The app contains an educational guide containing facts and detail about each high resolution tooth. This has been written by published experts in the field and gives a medically correct overview of the morphology of the teeth. Real Tooth Morphology can replace a dental textbook as a learning tool and has the advantage of being able to demonstrate the points shown using real 3D tooth models rather than flat diagrams.

All elements are combined and synchronised with audible narration.* Full length offline demonstrations of 11 regional anaesthetic techniques.* 3D Animated anatomical models, interlinked with live ultrasound scans.* Visualise a whole block from start to finish.* Clear narration during the procedure.* A source of tips and advice which we wished had been around when we started using ultrasound.* Easy accessed tabs for Anatomy, Procedure, and Tips.* Stunning full screen diagrams.* Annotated ultrasound screen shots.* Fantastic for the novice or experienced anaesthesia provider.* Learning tool for ODP\u2019s, ODA\u2019s, Anaesthetic nurses, PA(A)\u2019s, AA\u2019s, CRNA\u2019s and all staff working within regional anaesthesia.* Medical students can gain a better insight into regional anaesthesia.A tab system gives the user access to anatomy, procedure and tips. The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram\u2019s which can be expanded to full screen.

Check out what others are saying about it:R Grubb says: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605I love you!!! Unbelievably simple. Unbelievably accurate. Unbelievably great. Unbelievably well worth the $5 I paid for this!!!Kendig says: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best app ever Just got the app a week ago ut a major fan of the site....used the app all weekend at my critical care transport......app is great flow and easy to use and stright foward ....cant wait to see what else they come out withMatt says: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Awesome program! This program far exceeded my expectations and is great to confirm drip rates, especially as a field Medic at zero dark thirty. Keep up the good work!OmniMedix was created by a practicing street medic with simple design that allows the user to calculate the proper medication infusion rate within seconds instead of fumbling through endless menus. Agency protocols are different and medications in EMS come and go. The patent pending system behind OmniMedix is that it is the only calculator that allows the user to select the calculation to be performed based on infusion rates, not specific medications, which allows it to be used with virtually any medication. This allows it the versatility to be used in all clinical environments: EMS, Emergency Department, ICU, medical offices and even veterinary medicine. Also included are weight and temperature conversions, common pediatric calculations, medication bolus calculations, and the Parkland Burn Formula for fluid resuscitation. While most hospital units have IV pumps that take care of the drip rate, most EMS crews don\u2019t, and are either left to calculate drips by hand or \"titrate to effect\". Even if you have the luxury of an IV pump, can you quickly and accurately calculate the correct drip rate by hand if your pump fails? Your patient\u2019s life may depend on it! This app is a must have for anyone who administers IV medications, and is designed with those who rarely calculate drip rates in mind. Directions for use: Select the concentration being utilized (mcg/min, mcg/kg/min, etc) to enter its menu. Enter the patient\u2019s weight, the desired dose, medication concentration, and dripset being used. OmniMedix will display the proper flow rate in drops per minute, drops per second, and our proprietary \u201cseconds per drop\u201d, to simplify slower drip rates.

{"title": "DAF Professional", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Speech+Tools+Limited", "rating": "4.307692527770996", "Description": " DAF Professional has been developed to be the leading app to help people who stammer or have Parkinson's Disease.  It helps people to slow their rate of speech down which makes it sound clearer to others. DAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT).  DAF Professional is the most effective and efficient Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) currently on the Android Market. No other app delivers the low latency required for effective use.Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly.   However, until recently, devises have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.    DAF was origionally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010). It works by enabling someone to hear his or her speech in an altered manner.  This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups.  However, DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.   DAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.DAF Professional works during phone calls on many phones as well as operating as a standalone device.Please try our free version to see what DAF Professional can do for you!If you encounter any problems then please email to support@speechtools.co and we will do our very best to help you.

{"title": "EMDR For Clinicians", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Psychotherapy+Data+Systems", "rating": "3", "Description": " \"EMDR For Clinicians\" is the first clinician-grade EMDR application developed for use on Android platorms. We have designed this application from the ground up to allow for optimum ergonomics and ease-of-use in real world clinical settings. Following careful analysis of the existing EMDR device solutions (both hardware and software), we believe that we have developed a solution that is both immediately accessible for clinical users *and* provides the necessary flexibility for in-session adjustment. \u201cEMDR for Clinicians\u201d can be used with any set of headphones, or can be plugged into computer speakers.  It features adjustable frequency tones, synthesized especially EMDR use, as well as an adjustable volume. The application displays the duration of each reprocessing set, in seconds, for easier note-taking, and when stopped, the duration counter does not immediately return to zero, allowing the clinician to ergonomically make note of the duration of the reprocessing set. Background on EMDR: EMDR is a model of psychotherapy that has been demonstrated in many studies to be highly effective at treating the symptoms of trauma and other psychological issues. EMDR uses a structured eight-phase psychotheraputic approach which addresses the past, present, and future aspects of dysfunctionally stored memory. During the processing phases of EMDR, the client attends to the disturbing memory in multiple brief sets of about 15\u201330 seconds, while simultaneously focusing on the dual attention stimulus. Following each set of such dual attention, the client is asked what associative information was elicited during the procedure.Note: This application is for use only by clinicians who have received appropriate training in EMDR.  Features:\u00b7 \u201cEMDR for Clinicians\u201d can be used with any set of headphones, or can be plugged into computer speakers. \u00b7 Adjustable frequency tones designed for EMDR.\u00b7 Adjustable volume.\u00b7 Displays the duration of each reprocessing set, in seconds.Instructions for use:Please Note: this application  is designed only for use by properly trained clinicians.1.

{"title": "Voice Test", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Danube+Team", "rating": "5", "Description": " OVERVIEW:\u00a0This software offers you the chance to test your voice and check for vocal fold health risks.\u00a0Three important voice parameters are measured: frequency, jitter and shimmer. Values are compared to thresholds given in latest medical publications. POTENTIAL USERS:This application is primarily intended for smokers and people whose profession entails long tiring hours of voice use (educators, trainers, lawyers, businessmen, stock brokers, sales executives, communication professionals and vocal performers like radio jockeys, television anchors, broadcast journalists, etc\u2026), because they belong to a high-risk group for developing the vocal fold disease. Ideally, every adult person, male or female should test his/her voice. Application is not intended for children.THEORY BEHIND APPLICATION:Human voice is a very complex phenomenon. It is essentially the sound uttered through the mouth of a human. Voice is the result of synergy of many human organs, namely lungs, vocal folds and articulators (tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.) within vocal tract.\u00a0Sound is generated through the rhythmic opening and closing of the vocal folds. These organs are subject to various health risks. Experts in phoniatrics are able to determine the condition of vocal tract simply by hearing the human voice. They sometimes use sophisticated professional equipment, measure the voice parameters, evaluate the health condition of vocal folds and glottis and decide if medical treatment is required. The purpose of this program is to increase awareness among users to pay attention to the health of their vocal folds. Test results in this application have only indicative value and may in no case be a substitute for an examination performed by a professional.INTERNET PAGE:www.danubeteam.in.rsIPHONE:Also available on Apple Store (Name: Voice Test)GRAPHIC DESING:Ljiljana Vidovic\u2028  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.danubeteam.voicetest", "price": "EGP7.00", "date_published": "May 13, 2013", "email": "danubeteam@gmail.com", "downloads": "100 - 500", "category": "Medical", "developer": "Danube Team", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://danubeteam.in.rs/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFxqKpTJ73vWvnTS75DH02qOsqF4g", "reviewers": "1"}

{"title": "Dry Needling", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=OPUS+2", "rating": "4", "Description": " This programme is designed by Ren\u00e9 Fonville, general practitioner and dry needling therapist. The application features over 100 muscles with trigger points and referral patterns, and for every muscle there is a detailed description of function, anatomy and innervation in word and graphics.Dry needling is the use of a solid needle for therapy of muscle pain (myofascial pain). Dry needling contrasts with the use of a hollow needle to inject substances. Such use of a solid needle has been found to be as effective as injection of substances in such cases as relief of pain in muscles and connective tissue. Acupuncture and dry needling techniques may be similar, but their rationale and use in treatment are quite different.Dr. Janet Travell was an expert on myofascial pain - a term used to describe pain and dysfunction of skeletal muscles - and pioneered numerous techniques for dealing with chronic pain. Dr. Travell co-authored, with David Simons, the acclaimed two-volume book Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual. (Volume 1 was published in 1983 and dealt with the upper half of body, volume 2 was published in 1992 and dealt with the lower half.) Dr. Travell served as Associate (and later Emeritus) Clinical Professor of Medicine at The George Washington University, and remained an active figure up until her death at the age of ninety-five, writing, giving lectures, and attending conferences.The application is easy to use and a quick help in your daily \"myofascial pain\" practice.Ren\u00e9 Fonville, GP and dry needling therapist.

{"title": "Ventilator Calculator", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Cruthu+Services", "rating": "5", "Description": " The Ventilator Calculator is designed to provide the practitioner with a fast and easy way to initial ventilator settings, and a quick way to correct settings to tailor the ventilator to the particular patient\u2019s condition.   The Ventilator Calculator will provide initial ventilator setting is based on the patient\u2019s ideal body weight, and a normal metabolic rate.  The ideal body weight can be calculated by using height in inches or centimeters.  You may choose the normal 7.25 ml/Kg setting, or choose 10 ml/Kg, 8 ml/Kg.  It will also provide you the option of the ARDS protocol settings of 6 ml/Kg or 4 ml/Kg.  The Ventilator Calculator will also provide a suggested respiratory rate bases on normal metabolic rate at sea level.  However, as with any suggestion, the patient\u2019s current clinical status must be considered when setting the initial respiratory rate.    As an example, an individual patient in sever metabolic acidosis would need a greater respiratory rate then an individual being recovered from surgery.  Therefore, clinical evaluation of the situation would suggest you increase the respiratory rate higher than that suggested by the Ventilator Calculator.  The correction section of the Ventilator Calculator will give suggestions of corrections based on the patient\u2019s current condition.  If, therefore, the patient\u2019s condition is steadily worsening, then the Ventilator Calculator will help, but will not provide long-term answers to the worsening patient\u2019s needed.  However, it will correct for the patient\u2019s needs at that moment, helping you stay up with the patient\u2019s quickly changing needs.  In such a case, serial blood gases will be required, and corrections taken until the patient\u2019s condition stabilizes.    The Ventilator Calculator is an excellent tool, and can improve your ability to tailor the ventilator settings to a patient\u2019s condition.

Flow-charts and tables with drug descriptions, dosages, and brand names aid in fast decision-making in emergencies, at the patient\u2019s bedside, or during a routine office visit. Brand names may vary from country to country.Topics include common pathologies considered part of Primary Care, such as mild urologic emergencies, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract infections, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and male infertility. For Urologists, it is especially useful as a quick guide for managing emergencies (e.g. priapism, sepsis, Fournier\u2019s gangrene), uncommon diseases (e.g. urogenital TBC, postsurgical chylous ascites, recurrent nocturnal erections), perioperative care (e.g. antithrombotic and antibiotic prophylaxis, electrolytic and metabolic alterations), urological oncology, etc.  Other useful sections are those on normal lab values, drugs used in Urology, or the illustrated atlas of dermatological conditions of male genitals, including malignant and premalignant lesions and venereal diseases. The application also includes a chapter index and an index of abbreviations to make it easy to find the information in 2 or 3 screen touches.Other functions are:- Urology links: in-app browser access to several websites (e.g. calendars of urologic events, journals, validated questionnaires, prostate, bladder and kidney nomograms, free testosterone calculator and more).- Room for notes: available in each section to add your own information.- Voice notes: to record a conference or save your own voice notes.- Suggestion pages: send your comments, corrections, or suggestions to improve the application.

It is commonly used in medicine to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment.In about 10 minutes it samples functions including arithmetic, memory and orientation. It was introduced by Folstein et al. in 1975,[1] but is very similar to, or even directly incorporates, tests which were in use previous to its publication.[2][3][4] This test is not a mental status examination. The standard MMSE form which is currently published by Psychological Assessment Resources is based on its original 1975 conceptualization, with minor subsequent modifications by the authors.Other tests are also used, such as the Hodkinson[5] abbreviated mental test score (1972, geriatrics) or the General Practitioner Assessment Of Cognition as well as longer formal tests for deeper analysis of specific deficits.

It is meant to be a tool that supplements classroom learning and enhances critical thinking. It has been intentionally created to NOT be a drug guide with an overabundance of drug details suited for fields other than the nursing profession. The purpose of NurseTabs: Pharmacology is to provide the nursing student with essential components of pharmacological therapy and enhance the student\u2019s ability to retain important categorical drug information. This app highlights most common side effects and adverse reactions and focuses on encouraging nurses and nursing students to use their skills of assessment and teaching to safely administer drugs.~                                                           In addition this app is designed for the nursing student or beginning nurse to help learn concepts of pharmacology. It is organized by body system and by major drug categories. By learning common drug categories, the nurse can begin to recognize common considerations about all drugs within those categories. This may help enhance performance on the NCLEX licensure exam and will help nurses to recognize major considerations for each category. Each category of drugs is explained in simple terms using the nursing process. Included are common side effects, adverse reactions, rationale for use, nursing assessments, teaching, and drug names associated with each category. There is a search tab to look up over 200 drug categories and over 1775 individual drug names that might be used in various healthcare settings.
