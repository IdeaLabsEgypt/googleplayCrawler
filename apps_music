{"developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Zira+App", "Description": " SlankSlank adalah sebuah grup musik di Indonesia. Dibentuk oleh Bimbim pada 26 Desember 1983 karena bosan bermain musik menjadi cover band dan punya keinginan yang kuat untuk mencipta lagu sendiri. Dan berhasil menjadi salah satu musisi bersejarah dan dikenang serta berpengaruh sepanjang masa di Indonesia. Selain itu Slank juga menyandang predikat Indonesia's Highest-Paid Music Star (bintang musik berbayaran termahal) pada tahun 2008 dan 2009 dengan honor Rp 500 Juta per show.Awal KarierCikal bakal lahirnya Slank adalah sebuah grup bernama Cikini Stones Complex (CSC) yang dibentuk oleh Bimo Setiawan Almachzumi/Bimo Setiawan Sidharta (Bimbim) pada awal tahun 80-an. Band ini hanya memainkan lagu-lagu Rolling Stones dan tak mau memainkan lagu dari band lain, alhasil mereka akhirnya jenuh dan menjelang akhir tahun 1983 grup ini dibubarkan.[1]Bimbim meneruskan semangat bermusik mereka dengan kedua saudaranya Denny dan Erwan membentuk Red Evil yang kemudian berganti nama jadi Slank, sebuah nama yang diambil begitu saja dari cemoohan orang yang sering menyebut mereka cowok selengean[1] dengan personel tambahan Bongky (gitar) dan Kiki (gitar). Kediaman Bimbim di Jl. Potlot 14 jadi markas besar mereka dan menjadi situs wajib yang harus dikunjungi para Slanker.Mereka sempat tampil di beberapa pentas dengan membawakan lagu-lagu sendiri sebelum Erwan memutuskan mundur karena merasa tidak punya harapan di Slank.[1] Dengan perjuangan panjang terbentuklah formasi ke-13, Bimbim, Kaka, Bongky, Pay dan Indra, Slank baru solid.Dengan formasi Bimbim (Drum), Bongky (Bass), Pay (Gitar), Kaka (Vokal) dan Indra (Keyboard) mereka mulai membuat demo untuk ditawarkan ke perusahaan rekaman.[1]Setelah berulang kali ditolak, akhirnya tahun 1990 demonya diterima dan mulai rekaman debut album Suit... Suit... He... He... (Gadis Sexy). Album yang menampilkan hit Memang dan Maafkan itu meledak dipasaran sehingga mereka pun diganjar BASF Award untuk kategori pendatang baru terbaik. Album tersebut juga seakan \"menampar\" industri musik Indonesia yang kala waktu itu masih gencarnya lagu lagu Malaysia seperti tembang Issabella milik Search. Musik Slank yang Rock 'N Roll Blues itu bisa dibilang penyelamat kaum anak muda di Indonesia. Gayanya yang cuek dan slengean tapi bersahabat itu menarik massa yang saat itu masih sebatas minoritas.Album kedua mereka, Kampungan pun meraih sukses yang sama. [1]. Hits single dari album Kampungan adalah Mawar Merah dan Terlalu Manis yang dibuat dalam dua versi. Suka suka dan Jualan. Namun anehnya, justru lagu yang versi Suka suka lah yang menjadi hits dan sering dimainkan. Lagu nya memang damai karena Kaka bermain harmonika (bukan pertama kali ini saja Kaka bermain harmonika). Di album Kampungan ini pun,Slank memasukkan lagu Nina Bobo. Nafas Rock 'N Roll dan Blues masih terasa di album ini. Wajar,, karena nyawa musik Slank ada di situ.Tahun 1993 bulan Desember, Slank merilis Album ketiga yang diberi judul Piss!. Semboyan Peace di plesetkan menjadi Piss. Semboyan Piss menjadi trend pada masa itu (mungkin juga sampai sekarang). Hits single dari album ini adalah Piss dan Kirim Aku Bunga. Cover album ini adalah seorang model yang meniru pose Jim Morisson (The Doors). walaupun banyak yang berpendapat bahwa model di cover tersebut adalah Bimbim, namun faktanya model cover album tersebut adalah Adji 'tarmo' tetangga seberang rumah Bimbim.Tahun 1994, Slank lagi-lagi merilis sebuah album yang diberi titel Generasi Biru. Lagu ini juga sering dibawakan sampai saat ini. Hits single dari album ini adalah Generasi Biroe, Terbunuh Sepi, dan juga Kamu Harus Pulang yang sering dimainkan saat ending show mereka.Tahun 1995, tepatnya pada bulan Agustus, Slank mengisi sebuah acara di RCTI dalam rangka menyambut Hari Jadi Kemerdekaan Indonesia yang ke-50. Mereka membawakan beberapa lagu dari album Generasi Biru.Disclaimer :Semua gambar adalah milik Slank dan semua konten aka dihapus jika dikehendaki oleh pemilik yang legal. SlankSlank is a musical group in Indonesia. Formed by Bimbim on December 26, 1983 due to becoming bored playing music cover band and have a strong desire to create your own songs. And managed to become one of the historic and memorable musicians and influential of all time in Indonesia. In addition it also holds the title Slank Indonesia's Highest-Paid Music Star (Star highest-paid music) in 2008 and 2009 with a fee of Rp 500 million per show.Early CareerSlank is a forerunner to the birth of a group called Cikini Stones Complex (CSC) set up by Ben Setiawan Almachzumi / Ben Setiawan Sidhartha (Bimbim) in the early 80s. The band only plays the songs the Rolling Stones and do not want to play songs from other bands, and as a result they end up saturated by the end of 1983 the group disbanded. [1]Bimbim continue their musical spirit with his two brothers Denny and Erwan formed Red Evil which was later renamed so Slank, a name that is taken for granted from the scorn of people who often call them guys selengean [1] with additional personnel Bongky (guitar) and Kiki (guitar ). Bimbim residence on Jl. 14 pencils so their headquarters and should be mandatory site visit the Slanker.They had appeared at some stage by performing his own songs before Erwan decided to resign because he felt no hope at Slank. [1] With a long battle formations formed 13th, Bimbim, Kaka, Bongky, Pay and Indra, the new Slank solid.With the formation Bimbim (Drums), Bongky (Bass), Pay (guitars), Kaka (vocals) and Indra (Keyboard) they started making demos for record companies to offer. [1]After repeatedly rejected, finally accepted in 1990 and began recording demo debut album ... Suit Suit ... He ... He ... (Sexy Girl). The album featuring the hit and Pardon Granted it exploded in the market so that they were rewarded BASF Award for best newcomer. The album also seemed to \"slap\" the Indonesian music industry who was then still the incessant song song song Issabella Malaysia as belonging Search. Music Slank Rock 'N Roll Blues was arguably the savior of the young people in Indonesia. His style is cool and friendly slengean but it was interesting that when the mass was still limited to a minority.Their second album, Kampungan also achieve the same success. [1]. Kampungan hit single from the album is Too Sweet Red Rose and made in two versions. Selling likes and dislikes. But strangely, it was the version of the song Love like the one that became hits and are often played. Her song is peaceful because Kaka playing harmonica (not the first time this course Kaka playing harmonica). In this Kampungan any album, Slank put songs Nina Bobo. Breath Rock 'N Roll and Blues still felt in this album. Naturally, because the lives of Slank music there.In December 1993, Slank released third album titled Piss!. Peace slogan on plesetkan be piss. Piss motto become a trend at that time (perhaps until now). Hit single from this album is piss and I Send Flowers. The album cover is a model that mimics the pose of Jim Morrison (The Doors). although many argue that the model on the cover is Bimbim, but the fact the cover of the album is Adji 'Tarmo' neighbor across the Bimbim.In 1994, Slank was again released an album that was given the title Blue Generation. This song is often sung to date. Hit single from this album is Generation Biroe, Killed Sepi, and also You Should Return often played during the ending of their show.1995, precisely in August, Slank fill an event on RCTI to celebrate the Indonesian Independence Anniversary 50th. They performed several songs from the album Blue Generation.Disclaimer:All images are the property and all content Slank aka removed if desired by the legal owner.

The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning \"king\" in Latin), commonly abbreviated to T. rex, is a fixture in popular culture. The T. rex lived throughout what is now western North America, which then was an island continent named Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, 67 to 66 million years ago. It was among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event.Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus fore limbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest known land predators. In fact, the most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 m (40 ft) in length, up to 4 metres (13 ft) tall at the hips,and up to 6.8 metric tons (7.5 short tons) in weight. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex may have been an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and possibly sauropods, although some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest ongoing feud in paleontology; however, most scientists now agree that Tyrannosaurus rex was an opportunistic carnivore, both acting as a predator and scavenging.More than 50 specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex have been identified, some of which are nearly complete skeletons\".(c) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tracinggames.trexpiano", "category": "Music", "title": "T.
