You should have two partitions on SD card and both should be primary.The first FAT partition is your standard SD card storage. The second partition is used for application files and can be ext2, ext3, ext4, f2fs or FAT.You need to use a non-FAT file system (ext2, ext3, ext4 or f2fs) on your second partition in order to link app's private data files. Because the FAT file system (FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT) does not support UNIX file ownership or permissions and will cause a security breakdown of app's private files.Link2SD Plus can move app's private data files if you have a non-FAT partitionLink2SD does not create the second partition, you need to create it yourself. You can use any partition manager such as Minitool, Paragon, Easeus etc. for this. When you connect your phone to PC as mass storage, Android unmounts the first FAT partition but the second partition remains mounted.

I always reply!* The goal of this application is to provide even the newest Android user with a simple method to check their device for root (administrator/superuser) access. This is a very simple application to notify the user whether or not they have properly setup root access.This application will test the device for root access using a very simple, quick and reliable method. The su binary is the most common binary used on Android devices to grant and manage root access. Root Checker will check and verify that the su binary is located in a standard location on the device. Root Checker will also confirm the proper permissions and flags on the su binary in addition to testing that access is granted by the su binary.Many times users experience issues along the path of installing, configuring and gaining root access. For some users the process can seem complex while for others the process can seem simple. Regardless of the user's technical skill set, Root Checker, will quickly and correctly verify whether or not root access is 100% functioning. The process of confirming root access is sometimes known by other terms such as, gaining superuser access or gaining administrator access. Root Checker covers all these terms as they relate to one core function, being able to execute commands with root access.If the Superuser or SuperSU applications are installed and working properly, these applications will prompt the user to accept or deny the root access request from Root Checker. Accepting the request will allow Root Checker to check for root access. Denying the request will result in Root Checker reporting no root access.Please don't leave negative feedback about a concern, bug or issue! Instead, please email me, tweet me, contact me on my web site - http://joeykrim.com/contact, IRC, or on the forums (XDA, RootzWiki, SDX, etc.) with your feedback, suggestions and comments!I do my best to assist as many people as possible and appreciate all the support that has made this application successful!

SuperSU requires a rooted device !!!SuperSU allows for advanced management of Superuser access rights for all the apps on your device that need root. SuperSU has been built from the ground up to counter a number of problems with other Superuser access management tools.Features include:- Superuser access prompt- Superuser access logging- Superuser access notifications- Per-app notification configuration- Temporary unroot- Deep process detection (no more unknowns)- Works in recovery (no more segfaulting)- Works when Android isn't properly booted- Works with non-standard shell locations- Always runs in ghost mode- Wake on prompt- Convert to /system app- Complete unroot- Backup script to survive CyanogenMod nightlies- Icon selectable from 5 options + invisible- Theme selectable from 4 options- Launch from dialer: *#*#1234#*#* or *#*#7873778#*#* (*#*#SUPERSU#*#*)NOTE: Not all phones take both codes. On some phones you need to use single *# instead of double *#*#The Pro version additionally offers:- OTA survival mode (no guarantees)- Full color-coded command content logging (input/output/error)- Per-app logging configuration- Per-app user override- Grant/deny root to an app for a set amount of time- PIN protection- Per-app PIN protection- Adjust auto-deny countdownThe discussion and support thread can be found on XDA-Developers here:http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1538053SUPERUSERThis is meant to replace Superuser (if installed), you use either one or the other. You cannot combine them. Statements that this breaks Superuser are therefore completely nonsensical.NOTICE: A SPECIAL PROCEDURE IS NEEDED FOR UNINSTALLATION. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE APP, DO *NOT* JUST UNINSTALL IT, YOU *WILL* LOSE ROOT. Superuser access management runs through a so called \"su binary\". There can be only one of these at a time. So if you install SuperSU, your previous superuser access management solution will no longer operate. So if you want to switch back: (1) Open that application, and search for an option for it to install/update/replace the \"su binary\". (2) Confirm root-using apps are using the superuser solution you want. (3) Uninstall SuperSU.TRANSLATIONSWant to help translate SuperSU ? See http://www.getlocalization.com/supersu/ !

The uses are endless, and by locking individual apps instead of the entire phone you save yourself a lot of time!Here are the features:\u2605 Lock any of the apps on your phone with just one tap!\u2605 Use digital or pattern-style passcodes, just like the system lock.\u2605 You can exit apps briefly without needing to re-enter the passcode when returning.\u2605 Retrieve lost or forgotten credentials by answering a security question.Install Applock Master today, and forget your privacy worries!\u2606\u2606 Reminder \u2606\u2606This app does not prevent you from stopping or uninstalling apps in the normal way (from the system Settings app). It's also possible to circumvent locked apps this way. You may ask - why don't we monitor apps so that if a user terminates one from Settings we can restart it with the lock? The simple reason is: that kind of constant monitoring is not only intrusive but is also tough on your phone's battery. Luckily there's an easy solution: simply lock the Settings app itself from Applock Master. Make sure you remember your passcode!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605HTC One (m7)Adeiza YusufNothing better  I've tried all the app lockers on play store and external market and finally I found the one that works just the way I imagined it.

Thus, channel sorting on the TV is not needed anymore. Simply configure and sort your favorite channels on the remote.This app was tested with different Samsung TVs (B-, C-, D- E-, and F-Series), but it could happen that some devices are not supported.NOTE: The new H Series is currently NOT supported! Samsung changed the communication protocol and encrypted everything. In addition to that, Samsung don't want to provide any support about the protocol. I asked Samsung couple times. It seems that they don't want to support 3rd party apps. Sorry.Therefore, we support the Kickstarter project AnyMote Home https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1635386542/anymote-home-your-phone-the-ultimate-universal-rem?ref=adi to become more independent from the tv manufacturer in order to provide cool 3rd party apps for every TV.To ensure the support of such a variety of TVs, it could be that some buttons are either not working or multiple buttons have the same function.Smart Remote offers lots of cool features which allow simply working with Samsung Smart TV functionality.Have fun and explore other cool functions\u2026some are hidden behind long click events, so be attentive!Note: On Samsung B-Series TVs the app \"Remote Lan Control\" must be installed.Note: On Samsung C- und D-Series TVs the function \"Remote Control\" in the settings must be enabled.Note: On Samsung E- und F-Series TVs the App must be set as allowed remote application in the Allshare settings of the TV.Note: Since it is not possible to select the HDMI sources directly, the app has implemented a workaround.Thus, the HDMI button number does not corresponds to the HDMI number on the TV. The HDMI button number describes the number of active HDMI devices, e.g. when having two HDMI devices, use the buttons HDMI1 and HDMI2!Note: Check the tutorial video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqypuTe7N0Note: The app uses Google Analytics, which can be disabled in Settings/Info! No private information is stored in the app!Note: Smart Touch Pad works only on device which has at lease 4 point multitouch screens. On some HTC devices, the 5 point multitouch must be activated in the settings first.We assume no liability for damages on the mobile device or the TV!

Here's what you need to know about the rooting process, and where to find a guide for your phone.Android rooting is the process of allowing users of smartphones, tablets, and other devices running the Android mobile operating system to attain privileged control (known as \"root access\") within Android's sub-system.Rooting is often performed with the goal of overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices, resulting in the ability to alter or replace system applications and settings, run specialized apps that require administrator-level permissions, or perform other operations that are otherwise inaccessible to a normal Android user. On Android, rooting can also facilitate the complete removal and replacement of the device's operating system, usually with a more recent release of its current operating system.

{"title": "Font Installer \u2605 Root \u2605", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=JRummy+Apps+Inc.", "rating": "3.876807928085327", "Description": " The best Font Installer on Android! Select from hundreds of custom fonts to install system wide! Preview, backup, install from SD card and share your fonts.This app is for rooted devices only! If you don't know what root is then please do not download this app. This app is also available in ROM Toolbox Pro along with many more features.If you have any problems and/or questions feel free to email us at jrummy.apps@gmail.com. We will provide fast and friendly support.Warning:Changing fonts modifies your system files. You should always have a current backup in recovery and know how to restore your device back to stock.FAQs:My fonts won't change.Font Installer overwrites the font files in the /system/fonts directory. To install a font you must have root access and S-OFF (for HTC devices). Some apps use their own font and cannot be overwritten by Font Installer.Before attempting to install any fonts please make sure you backup your fonts. You should also have a current nandroid backup.Font Installer needs to overwrite the correct system files. Please make sure you have the correct fonts selected to be overwritten.If you\u2019re running Android 4.0 ICS or newer, make sure Roboto-Regular.ttf is selected.If you\u2019re running Android 3.X or earlier, make sure DroidSans.ttf is selected.If you\u2019re running MIUI, make sure Arial.ttf is selected.To change which fonts get overwritten open Font Installer and click Menu >> Preferences >> Select Fonts.How do I restore the original font?To restore your font to the default system font press the menu button while inside Font Installer, click \u201cBackup and Restore\u201d, and restore the original fonts you had (assuming you made a font backup before changing fonts).Alternatively, you can choose the accurate font for your Android OS version according to the list below:If you\u2019re running Android 4.0 ICS or 4.1 JellyBean, install the \u201cRoboto\u201d font.If you\u2019re running Android 3.X or earlier, install the \u201cDroidSans\u201d font.If you\u2019re running MIUI, install the \u201cArial\u201d font.If all else fails, a last resort would involve re-flashing your ROM or restoring a nandroid backup of the /system partition (a factory reset would not touch the system partition where fonts are stored).Special characters aren't supported. What's the deal?Unfortunately we cannot fix this issue. You can install a custom typeface that supports your language or other special characters.

If you have secure key-guard enabled, try \"Hibernate and Lock Screen\" shortcut or \"Pull up\" gesture on Home soft-key.Never should your phone or tablet become slower and battery hungrier after lots of apps installed. With Greenify, your device can run almost as smoothly and lastingly as it did the first day you had it!Greenify help you identify and put the misbehaving apps into hibernation when you are not using them, to stop them from lagging your device and leeching the battery, in an unique way! They can do nothing without explicit launch by you or other apps, while still preserving full functionality when running in foreground, similar to iOS apps!Please report bugs in the XDA forum (http://goo.gl/ZuLDnE) or G+ community (http://goo.gl/MoszF).Greenify NEVER EVER collects your personal data despite the capability of accessibility service, it just takes advantage of it to automate things.IMPORTANT: Greenifying an app implies that you are aware that all the background functionality (service, periodic task, event receiver, alarm, widget update, push message) of this app will become out of service during the hibernation except when you are using this app.NEVER greenify alarm clock apps, instant messaging apps unless you don't rely on them. Please do verify the impact of greenified apps on which you heavily rely.Compared to other popular tools aimed for the similar purpose, Greenify offers the following advantages:\u25c6 Unlike the \"Freeze\" feature in \"TitaniumBackup Pro\" that totally disable the app, you can still use your app as usual, share content with it. No need to freeze & defrozen it.\u25c6 Unlike \"Autostarts\", you can benefit from almost all of its advantages, without needing to deal with the complexity and risk of obscure app components, and never lose functionality when app is actively running.\u25c6 Unlike any \"XXX Task Killer\", your device will never fall into the cat-mouse-game of stealthy-running and aggressive killing, which unnecessarily consumes more battery juice.Note: Greenify does need a background running service for auto-hibernation to work. It is designed and implemented in extremely lightweight, with an average RAM footprint less than 5M, and nearly zero CPU and battery consumption.In case you cannot install from Play Store: http://oasisfeng.com/Greenify.apk=== PERMISSIONS ===INTERNET: Needed by \"Raise Your Voice\" program to send back only small amount of anonymous statistics data, without privacy information.

It was about 2013,   I noticed that there was a little secret hiding in the Android System, some interesting symbols in the system. It took me one week to study on these symbols and it seemed very very interesting to me. Although my co-workers thought it was a waste of time, I realized that messages delivered by symbols, sometimes are much better than words. Additionally, it could make your text, Facebook messages more personalized.  In the meantime, I was studying the Android development, so I developed this small program when I was at home after work and posted on Google Play. Unexpectedly, Coolsymbols was more than welcome on internet, having more and more downloads. More and more users have encouraged me that I am motivated to keep developing the new versions. I have launched some Picture Expression Packages with some other artists in the world.

This means truly accurate file discovery and restoration. No padding - you see the files you deleted, because those are the ones you need.For free, the app will restore only image files. Purchase the key to unlock full functionality - undelete any file type, remove adverts and enable background scanning. IMPORTANT NOTE: Some files that are discovered during a scan may fail to recover as the data can be corrupted beyond repair, just like desktop based solutions. Similarly, files that are recovered may fail to open or play back due to degeneration. Save the restored files and transfer them to your desktop. Then open the files with an appropriate application - chances are they will play back or be readable or partially so.

If you want to contribute a translation, please let us know by sending us an email ;)If you find a bug, please contact us using the \"Report a bug\" main menu function.Note: if you write a comment on the Android Market without sending us an email, it's difficult for us to fix the problem, because usually we need some information (such as smartphone type and version, a way to replicate the problem, etc.).Note:- Depending on the hardware capabilities of your device, some tools may not be shown- The permission to use the camera is required in order to turn on the camera flash LED. Some devices (for instance the Google Nexus S) don't light the flash LED if the camera is not running. If you check the most popular flashlight apps, you'll find out that they all require this permission. Swiss Army Knife doesn't shoot any photos, doesn't save multimedia info onto the flash card and doesn't send anything via the internet: it doesn't require network permissions at all.

Simply run the application and the settings tab will appear! Remember: Whistle detection is working ONLY when the device is sleeping (i.e. when the screen is OFF).Once enabled, Whistle Android Finder FREE will truly work \"forever\" even if you reboot your Android device! Of course, you can disable it under the settings tab at any time. Whistle Android Finder FREE integrates the ability to release the microphone of your Android device during incoming or outgoing calls or when the screen of your device is ON! After a call ends, the normal background operation of whistle detection will resume automatically.It is possible to choose among 5 different whistle detection sensitivity levels! Whistle Android Finder FREE is just ready to adapt to any Android device regardless of the specifics of integrated acoustic components.Under the Whistle Android Finder FREE settings tab it is possible to choose among 18 different very amusing audio notification sounds to notify the presence of the detected whistle! Furthermore, Whistle Android Finder FREE includes now the option to select your own customized notification sound! Just select any of yours MP3 or M4A music file and use it as notification sound!Once your whistle is detected, the Android device will respond to your whistling with playback of a selected audio notification signal.

Under the preferences tab a user can also select (and approve) the usage of maximum possible volume for audio notification regardless of current media volume settings.

The incorporated DSP algorithm is not signal energy based, therefore this whistle detector is much more accurate and reliable than similar applications found elsewhere on Google Play.

Man's height is 1.7m(5.6ft), a golf flag is 7ft, a bus is 3.2m(10.5ft), a door is 2.1m(7ft). With that, we can guess the height of almost everything. It can be very useful to golfers.Usage is simple: Input the height of the target, and touch the screen. If the target is aligned by 2 lines, get the measured distance.* Now, 3 tools for distance were completed.1) Smart Ruler (Short, touch) : 1-50cm 2) Smart Measure (Medium, trigonometry) : 1-50m3) Smart Distance (Long, perspective) : 10m-1km* Pro version added features:- Measuring distance by width of the target- Smart distance and Speed Gun are integrated- Scroll arrow buttons- Camera Zoom- No ads* Do you want more tools?Get [Smart Distance Pro] and [Smart Tools] package.For more information, see the manual, Youtube video and the blog.

Align, in azimuth, the offset arm of the satellite dish to the cyan arrow on the phones display and the satellite dish is aligned in azimuth with the satellite.Selectable audio tone, camera preview, continuous mode (no pause), color pickers or a user defined satellite position may make it easier for you to find the desired TV satellite. The satellite list contains 280 satellites.Optional you can take a photo (resized)/screenshot by touching on the director tab. The photo/screenshot is ONLY stored on the phones memory card.Optional: you can get an indication when you are to close to iron (dish/pole) in the form of an green/yellow/red bar.Warning: The compass of your phone can get inaccurate because it is\u00a0affected by magnetic fields or because it is weakened by age. Calibrating the compass may not help.Satellite positions are derived from Agi's database. Some positions may seem not accurate (example: Hispasat 30\u00b0w is at 29.96\u00b0w in the satellite list) but they are very accurate.New phones with Android 4: in case of a wrong compass reading the \"Settings\" screen has options to correct the compass readings !!!!The market page may state this app is compatible with your device but I have learned that that is not always the case. The only sensor you need is orientation (compass). Use app \"Sensor List\" to verify that your device has it.PRECISION DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF YOUR HARDWARE.Metal objects can cause interferences.Previous versions are available from my website.If you have any questions, requests or problems PLEASE write an email. All language translations by Google Translator.3 tips to success:1- do NOT go to close to the iron dish, iron lnb arm or iron pole (keep at least 30 cm distance)2- calibrate the compass of the phone by waving it in a figure 8 before you start3- optional: calibrate the compass of the phone by rolling your phone along its length axis about 2-3 turns (works on some phones)  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zekitez.com.satellitedirector", "price": "0", "date_published": "August 31, 2014", "email": "zekitez@gmail.com", "downloads": "1,000,000 - 5,000,000", "category": "Tools", "developer": "Zekitez", "content_rating": "Low Maturity", "operating_system": "1.6 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://members.home.nl/zekitez/satdir/index.html&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHuVFYYCjjj6G_NbWNNmOgjhXFsbg", "reviewers": "14864"}

{"title": "Secure Wipe", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Pinellas+CodeWorks", "rating": "3.9034483432769775", "Description": " No root required. Free and contains no Adware. Does not connect to the internet.In our continued effort to make this work with KitKat, we have had mixed results.  So, if you are running KitKat, it may or may not work for you until I get time to investigate the issues with some phones. But, it's a free app with no ads and works for most people.Please provide feedback to the developer rather than giving a low rating so that I can fix whatever is wrong. Also feel free to suggest improvements. Thank you.It is possible to forensically extract information from a smart phone using mobile forensic tools such as Cellebrite and XRY even after it has been deleted. This utility can help to prevent that from happening by sanitizing the free space on a phone. Similar functionality can be found on desktop machines using utilities like CCleaner, Eraser, and File Shredder.  If you are afraid of the government peeking at your phone and extracting and reconstructing deleted files, this is the app that you want.This application does not delete files or clean the cache. Use other tools such as ES File Explorer and AVG Cleaner to delete files and clean the cache.  Then use this utility to sanitize the free space.  The free version of this application does not sanitize database areas such as contacts, phone logs, or SMS text messages. Look for a pro version in the future that may perform a more thorough sanitization.Although we cannot guarantee that all free space will be sanitized, this application finds all of the free space that Android will give us in three primary areas where data is normally stored and overwrites it as completely as the phone will allow:1. System - This is the protected data area shared by all applications. 2. SD Card - On some phones this is the actual SD Card and on others it is emulated SD Card space.3. Optional SD Card - On some phones this is the actual SD Card and many other phones do not have this space. Samsung phones typically put the real external SD Card here.To run the application:1. Make sure that the phone has good battery/wall power.2. Put a checkmark next to the sections of memory to sanitize.3. Press the Start Wiping button.4. Do not use the phone while the application is working.The status area will indicate how the process is going.Some have complained that after a wipe, they sometimes still see old files that were deleted using Hexamob or other similar apps.  In my investigation I have found that the overwhelming majority of files are overwritten but occassionally one file is left intact.  This could occur if Android does not allow us to write to every free sector. Watch the statistics as it is overwriting to see if the free space count goes to 0 as it is writing. Also run the app more than once to get more thorough wiping since SD cards rotate their sectors in and out of service.Many SD cards rotate blocks of memory in and out of use for wear leveling.  As a result, it is possible that after sanitizing memory there could be some blocks that get rotated back in to use that were never sanitized.  To mitigate this possibility, run this application twice which statistically will usually hit all blocks of memory. This application has not been tested on all phones.  Please provide feedback to the developer about any problems.  It has been found to work on Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 and Victory phones, the HTC Arrive and others.  System space takes several minutes to sanitize and 8GB SD Cards can take up to half an hour.  If the application is aborted before it finishes, there may be large files left on the phone. If this happens, simply reboot the phone and bring the application up and it will automatically look for these files and delete them at startup.

You can also set which notification type has the highest priority and let it flash in just that one color.Note that it will take over control of your notifications and you will therefore only get notifications for categories that the app allows.The app requires you to add \"accessibility\" for \"light flow lite\" - as this allows better control of the notifications. We do not capture your data, this is just a standard message shown when adding accessibility.

(READ BELOW.)Cheat Droid is a developer's tool. You are a developer and want to debug the shared preferences of your apps and games? You care about data privacy and want to see, what apps save which information about you? You forgot your password in your own app or game and try to recover it? You are simply some sort of \"hacker\" and simply technically interested?Then give Cheat Droid - Shared Preferences Editor a try! Shared Preferences are the most common way for Android apps and games to store settings or information inside your phone data. For example, a puzzle game might store the current level inside this file. Or other games might store your money, gold count, highscore or whatever in it. Apps might track, how many times you started them. Or when was the last time.However, please note the disclaimer below. Cheat Droid is rather adapted for technical, scientifical and debugging reasons.FEATURES\u2605 view, edit, add, search through and delete shared preferences\u2605 export and import preference files\u2605 browse through sqlite database files\u2605 export and import any other application files (CheatDroid \u2605 PRO only)\u2605 edit sqlite database files (CheatDroid \u2605 PRO only)OTHER USERS ABOUT CHEATDROID\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Outstanding - Love everything about this app\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Stay in school, kids. - The number of bad ratings on this app because it requires root [...] is downright depressing.

Therefore, you need a rooted phone for CheatDroid.For some apps I do not find a lot of Shared Preferences to edit, why?Since no developer is forced to USE Shared Preferences, those apps might use another way to store their settings. CheatDroid does not work everywhere.How do I get my phone rooted?Check out the internet, you will definitely find enough material. For instance, you could google \"Rooting [your phone name+model]\". Also, you might want to try out one of these links:\u2605 http://www.androidcentral.com/root\u2605 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting\u2605 http://gizmodo.com/5982287/reasons-to-root-your-android-device\u2605 http://google.about.com/od/socialtoolsfromgoogle/a/root-android-decision.htm\u2605 http://www.androidrooting.com/DISCLAIMERCheat Droid needs root access - accordingly, every use of it can also negatively affect the functionality of other apps or even of the whole system!

Refund requested in \"Orders\" of Google Play (or Google Wallet) within 7 days is guaranteed. (may take days to manually process). REQUESTS BY EMAIL WILL BE IGNORED.=== Disclaimer ===Some of these experimental features are still in early stage. They may not work on all devices & ROMs. They are included only for advanced users with sufficient knowledge about what they really mean and how to correctly use them. These features may crash your apps, or even brick your phone in the extreme cases. I will try my best to avoid those situations, but I don't take responsibility about the possible consequences. For your safety, please do a NANDroid backup before activating these features.It is safe to purchase and install, since nothing is affected until any of the experimental features is enabled explicitly.=== Experimental Features ===\u25c6 Boost mode (requires Xposed)Android framework is patched to allow Greenify to perform hibernation and other operations without the slow root routine. Besides, Boost mode also improves compatibility of many features in Greenify.\u25c6 Allow (most) system apps to be greenified in GreenifyBeware, most system apps are critical to the basic functionality of your device, once greenified, you may lose some part of usability. If something bad happens, degreenify the system apps you recently greenified and reboot, or deactivate this experimental features of Greenify and reboot.\u25c6 Allow GCM push message to wake hibernated apps (requires Xposed)Google service framework is patched to allow the GCM (Google Cloud Message, a.k.a. C2DM) broadcast to wake the hibernated apps, thus you can greenify some apps without losing the ability to receive push message.Attention: Not all apps use GCM as push mechanism, some apps create their own connection for push in background service, thus can't benefit from this patch and their push messages can never survive hibernation. Please DO NOT ask for that, it's just a \"mission impossible\" in practice. Instead, ask their developer to adopt the more RAM-and-battery-friendly GCM push.\u25c6 Keep Notifications after HibernationAndroid framework is patched to keep notifications from being removed when application hibernates.\u25c6 Wake-up Tracker (requires Xposed)Android framework is patched to track which app implicitly woke your hibernated apps. You can decide whether to cut-off the wake-up path to avoid further wake-ups.\u25c6 Block App State Abuse. (requires Xposed)Block the the abuse (via a vulnerability of Android up to 4.2) used by some apps to keep themselves from being killed by Android. This abuse leads to undesired apps \"Not Hibernating\" due to false \"Perceptible\" state in Greenify.PS: For Android 4.3+, this can also remove the annoying permanent notification from some apps, which was hidden in pre-4.3 system.=== Xposed Installation ===1. Download and install Xposed installer: http://goo.gl/CKTWXZ2. Install the \u201cFramework\" in the \"Xposed Installer\" and activate \"Greenify\" in \"Modules\".3. Reboot=== Why do I need to install another framework for some features to work? ===Since these experimental features all need OS level patches, traditionally they can only be applied with ROM modding, which is highly device-specific and ROM-exclusive. Xposed framework is a new hope to do finer grained tiny patches in a ROM-independent way. Thanks to Xposed framework, you can enjoy these experimental features of Greenify without replacing your ROM.=== Feedback and further discussion ===Visit the community: http://goo.gl/MoszF or XDA forum: http://goo.gl/ZuLDnE  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify.pro", "price": "EGP20.82", "date_published": "December 31, 2013", "email": "play.google.com@public.oasisfeng.com", "downloads": "50,000 - 100,000", "category": "Tools", "developer": "Oasis Feng", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "3.1 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plus.google.com/112105199234363320140&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNH4Dn3vJI1pT0X3Q_njWbiK1jpaQw", "reviewers": "7595"}

SetCPU works with a great variety of Android devices and ROMs, including the HTC One series, Samsung Galaxy series, and Nexus devices. You're under control: SetCPU can improve your performance, save battery, or both!Automate SetCPU with profiles! SetCPU allows you to set up powerful profiles to change your settings under certain conditions, such as what app is running, when the phone is asleep or charging, when the battery level drops below a certain point, when the phone's temperature is too high, or during certain times of day. See the screenshots for examples of how you might set up profiles.SetCPU's wide feature set make it useful to Android beginners and enthusiasts alike. Accelerate your processor to unleash your phone's true multitasking potential, or dial your CPU's speed down to save battery.SetCPU also includes a \"voltage control\" menu, available to certain devices with custom kernels that support it, to control undervolting to save even more battery. Undervolting is only available for certain kernels.3.1.0Hey guys! It's good to be back ;) I have been very busy with school for the past year. 3.1.0 is mostly a bug fix release for some standing issues, but expect much more frequent updates from now on.- Added SUPERUSER permission.- Fixed a bug where action bar menu items would sometimes not appear for the profiles menu.- Fixed a bug where voltage items would appear in reverse with some custom kernels.- Added an open source licenses menu item in About.Mike \"coolbho3k\" HuangPermissions:Root: SetCPU needs root permissions to modify the CPU speed and other settings.Read logs: is used for efficient app condition checking.

Sixaxis Controller allows you to use your PS3 Sixaxis, DualShock 3 and Navigation controllers in many of your favourite games and applications.*** IMPORTANT ***- ROOT access is required!!!- Due to the way pairing is done with the controllers, you need to manually pair your controller with the PC utility 'SixaxisPairTool' (available on the website) and a mini-USB cable.

You start by starting the app and the app will check your system has everything it needs to continue (like root). It may need to download an additional package, so it is advised you have Wi-Fi available.Now you should see the main Mobile ODIN screen. It will list a set of partitions. Clicking a partition will allow you to select a file from your SD card to flash to that partition. Do not worry about selecting the wrong file - Mobile ODIN will not let you. Separate files (named after the partition) as well as .tar and .tar.md5 files are supported.From the desktop ODIN you may be used to \"PDA\", \"PHONE\", and \"CSC\" buttons. All three of these buttons have been replaced by the \"Open file ...\" button. This button will open the file you select from the SD card, and find all the partitions it can flash inside that file. So if you select a .tar file containing kernel and modem, the Kernel and Modem partitions will be set up to use that .tar file for flashing.Now that we have selected what we want to flash, if you have the Pro version you can proceed to the EverRoot section. The EverRoot options allows you to root your firmware while it is being flashed. Never again will you be without root! Select here which apps you want to inject in the firmware that is being flashed.Now that we are all done selecting partitions and configuring EverRoot, we continue to \"Flash firmware\". Mobile ODIN will gather all the information it needs and perform the flash. Before starting, however, it will check that your battery level is over 50%, and if applicable offer to verify MD5 checksums on the files you have selected to flash. If all is well, it will reboot into recovery mode, and flash the firmware you have selected.

The usual way of getting into \"download mode\" is by first turning off your device, then turning it on by pressing and holding VolDown+(Home)+Power. Alternatively, the \"adb reboot download\" command also often works.When you run TriangleAway, if your device and firmware are supported, it will show you the detected state of the binary (custom or official) and flash counter value, and the option to \"Reset flash counter\". Please confirm that the information shown is correct before resetting the values.On a number of devices, TriangleAway can work, but your firmware may not be supported directly. In that case, the app will tell you it needs to reboot into a special boot mode, which will be happen if you select \"Reset flash counter\". The device will reboot into a special mode which will allow you to review the current status and reset the binary and flash counter values (or abort and do nothing). On some devices this will actually trigger the counter to 1 if its 0 - so if you're \"just checking\", do that in download mode!!!! THIS IS A DANGEROUS OPERATION AND COULD POTENTIALLY BRICK YOUR DEVICE. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK. A USB JIG IS PREFERRED IF YOU HAVE A WORKING ONE !!!( and by brick I mean brick - only a board replacement or a JTAG unit will be able to save you, don't mess with boot(loader) stuff unless you *really* mean it! )Note#1: using Triangle Away may unmount your SD card. Reboot or manually remount it from Android settings.Note#2: on new devices status can only be reset on stock firmwares!Supported devices:SG S2:- GT-I9100 **- Sprint Epic 4G Touch- Korea SHW-M250K/L/SSG S3:- GT-I9300/I9300T **- GT-I9305/I9305T/I9305N LTE **- USA: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mo, VZW (unlock bootloader !), USCC, MetroPCS, Cricket, CSpire- Canada- Korea: SHV-E210K/L/S, SHW-M440SSG S4:- GT-I9505- USA: AT&T, VZW, Sprint, T-Mo, USCC- CanadaSG Note:- GT-N7000- GT-I9220SG Note 2:- GT-N7100/N7100T/N7102/N7105/N7105T **- USA: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mo, VZW (unlock bootloader !), USCC- Canada: I317M, T889V- Korea: SHV-E250K/L/S **SG Note 3 (4.4+):- GT-N9005 - USA: T-Mobile, Sprint- Canada: SM-N900W8- Asia: SM-N900S/2/6/8/9SG Note 8.0\":- GT-N5100 3G **- GT-N511x Wi-Fi **- GT-N5120 LTE **SG Note 10.1\":- GT-N8000 3G **- GT-N801x Wi-Fi **- GT-N8020 LTE **- SHW-M480S/K/W **SG Camera EK-GC100 **SG Tab 2:- GT-P310x 7\" 3G- GT-P311x 7\" Wi-Fi- GT-P510x 10.1\" 3G- GT-P511x 10.1\" Wi-FiVarious:- I8160, I8190- I9070/P- I9082- I9260- S7500, S7560, S7562** Various models are supported depending on firmware, but only the exact models listed are supported regardless of firmware version.Whether or not Triangle Away works may depend on your kernel, try flashing a different one if it doesn't work.Please also note that some devices set the counter to 1 at every boot if you are running a custom kernel or recovery. On these devices, Triangle Away may always display 1 - make sure to check the counter in actual download mode.For discussion and technical details, see the XDA-Developers.com thread here:http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1494114Note that this download is also available from that thread completely for free.

If you step into a dimly lit room, Lux will automatically lower the brightness of your display to make it not only comfortable to read, but to also preserve battery power.Lux is also able to adjust the screen temperature of your display automatically to make it appropriate for night usage. At sunset, you can have Lux automatically warm your display and switch to your Night profile. If you're an astronomer, you can enable astronomer mode to cut out harsh white light. If you have a root enabled phone, you may even be able to apply these enhancements at a low level with Lux's plug-in system.Perhaps the best thing about Lux is that you can teach it how to behave. If the backlight is too bright or dim for your liking, simply open the provided Dashboard, adjust the brightness slider to the level you desire, then hold the link button. Lux will use this new 'link' as a reference in future.Give it a go! I want you to test Lux for more than the 15 minute refund period offered by Google. I understand that some devices may not have the best quality light sensor, and that you may need more time to play around with settings.

They have received special importance. Normally they are only divided into weak, good and excellent signals. Graphically there are mostly \"only\" three to five bars shown as a mobile signal and three \"waves\" shown as a WiFi connection.My app differentiates the signal strength into a total of 14 bars. This will give you a quick visualized and detailed information on your signal strength. In addition to the more sophisticated graphical representation of the signal strength you will also be able to see some more interesting information.Furthermore, there is a log function in csv-file format for wireless and mobile signal strength available (for e.g. Excel import).With \"Mobile Signal\":Network operators, sim provider, phone type, network type, network strength in dbm and ASU, data state, data activity, country code of the mobile phone, device ID, IP address (internal und external), roaming state.

There's a link to a trial version!The app is intended for automatic call recording from the phone line where supported by hardware and kernel.Root access is a must for many phones, as manufacturers often won\u2019t implement the required functionality.There are 4 recording methods: - Standard API - CAF (root required) - ALSA (root requried) - Kernel (root required)Standard API - method which doesn\u2019t require root access. Check out every audio source before using. Many phones support recording using this method, from the microphone only (audio source \u201cMicrophone\u201d should be selected).CAF and ALSA - both methods require root access. Device settings in settings \u2192 recording are very important here. If your phone isn\u2019t listed, select a device which has the same chipset as yours. The main difference between CAF and ALSA is that CAF doesn\u2019t require ALSA installation, and supports more functions.Kernel - recording method for phones based on old chipsets by Qualcomm; root is required. This method doesn\u2019t guarantee 2 way call recording.Which recording method is better?Neither recording method can ensure that your calls will be recorded from the line; this is phone-specific.

Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about this; Volume+ will no longer work on newer devices.Some devices running 4.1 CAN make use of this application (Samsung Galaxy S 3 international, HTC One X, etc.) but the majority will not.

Google broke it!Please note; Incompatible devices running certain custom firmwares may still be able to make use of this application.This application can be downloaded for FREE on my website along with beta builds that have not yet been released.** PowerAmp Fix - http://androidaudiohacks.com/?page_id=571 **Thanks.Tested and Fully working on the Samsung Galaxy S III!! (Doesn't currently work on the Sprint Version. No idea why.)This application was designed primarily to boost the volume of a wired headset. Whilst it will boost the main loudspeaker volume, it may not be as prominant. Please bare this in mind.Millions of people blame bad headphones for low-quality music, well put the blame where it belongs; your phone and the audio software. Volume+ can fix the issue system wide. Using Volume+ your phone will get a boost in bass, treble, and if you're using our presets, you can finally experience the quality of music that you truly deserve. Being system wide, Volume+ works with Google Music, Pandora, Slacker, and every other music software on your device (that doesn't have a built in EQ). Volume+ might not get you the same experience that you get with those over priced headphones, but what we can promise you is that for $2, you will get music that is finally worth listening to. There may be issues on certain custom ROMs.This software does not function the same on every ROM out there, we personally recommend using a Cyanogen Mod 7 or MIUI ROMs, but we do try our best to optimize our software for all software versions. Stock users message us if you're not getting an improved experience. We highly recommend you use this with caution because while we do allow you to literally go crazy with the way you hear your music, you can seriously damage your hearing and possibly lose it. So please don't go crazy with our application, we want you to enjoy yourself not hurt yourself (please see disclaimer below).DISCLAIMER:By downloading this application you agree to the fact that, as this app exploits the EQ API included in Gingerbread and it is not meant to be achieved under normal circumstances, I am NOT to be held responsible for anything negative that may occur, such as breakage to your phone or phone's speaker.I will also take no responsibility for any damage that may occur to your hearing. This app will allow you to boost the volume of the headset, bluetooth headset and modify the inbuilt EQ settings. As a result, you can now increase the volume of the headset/bluetooth headset way above the recommended maximum and so, may cause permanent damage to your speaker and/or hearing.*********This app is available for FREE on my website - www.androidaudiohacks.com*********Download and use at your own risk.

{"title": "SystemPanel App / Task Manager", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=NextApp,+Inc.", "rating": "4.673514366149902", "Description": " SystemPanel integrates a task manager, app manager (installer/uninstaller with multi-version APK archival), and system monitor.  Solve your battery life problem by enabling the background monitoring service to record long-term CPU usage by individual apps.SystemPanel includes the following features:Task Manager: The task manager shows what applications are currently loaded into memory and/or running on a device, including current CPU and memory utilization for each.  The task manager provides the ability to kill offending applications, and includes an emergency \"end all\" widget to handle extreme scenarios.System Monitor: The system monitor can be enabled to record device usage history over a period of time (up to one week), such that you can determine what applications and usage patterns have the greatest impact on battery life.  This feature is commonly used to help track down which applications are having major negative effects on battery life.  The system monitor records CPU usage for each process, overall CPU usage, display usage, battery level, and battery charging status.Installer: The installer enables you to install and uninstall applications quickly and conveniently.  It can archive multiple versions of applications, such that you can backup your apps before an update and revert back to older versions afterward.  This is useful in the not uncommon event the updated item is buggy or otherwise undesirable.  Additionally, the Installer is designed to work much more efficiently than the standard Android application manager, and does not suffer the frustrating lag issues found in the default Android item when browsing through a large number of installed apps.Device Information: The device information screens show detailed information about your Android device, including storage, capabilities, network state, and OS build information.-- Frequently Asked Questions --Why does it require the ______ permission? - SystemPanel does require a fair number of permissions in order to be able to perform all of its duties.  This product DOES NOT send ANY information from your device over the Internet to ANYONE.  It requires the \"Internet access\" and \"telephony/read phone state\" permissions only to monitor and display the device's network connectivity state.  A full description of why each permission is required can be found in the SystemPanel FAQ on our web site.Does SystemPanel consume battery?- The only component of SystemPanel which runs in the background is the \"System Monitor\" feature.  This feature must be enabled by the user (by default, SystemPanel runs nothing in the background).  When enabled, the System Monitor feature will record data about which applications are consuming the battery every 15 minutes.  All told, this feature will use approximately one minute of CPU / battery time per day of operation.  When this feature is not enabled, SystemPanel will not run in the background in any capacity.Does SystemPanel automatically kill tasks in the background?- No, SystemPanel is not an automatic task killer.  It has been well-established (by the Android documentation and direct communication with the Android engineers) that randomly or periodically terminating arbitrary tasks in the interest of saving memory will NOT yield a benefit in performance or battery life.  The only benefit you will see from an automatic task killer is if it happens to terminate misbehaving apps.  SystemPanel provides a better solution to this problem by showing you which apps are consuming CPU in the background (over time) with the \"System Monitor\" feature.  It is then recommended that such applications be reconfigured or uninstalled (or perhaps corrected by filing a bug with the offending application's author).A much more extensive FAQ is available on our web site.Please visit our web site at http://android.nextapp.com for more information, including a complete screenshot tour of the product.

If you don't have root a Windows, Mac or Linux computer required to complete the installation, but after this it's not required to make screen recordings. Capture videos of your minecraft worlds, make screen recordings for promotional videos, tutorials, screencasts or simply share your finest moments! Recordable is the screen recorder which: * Is simple to install and easy to use * Records your audio and gestures * Supports almost all tablets and phones * Easily shares videos to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter etc.   * Does not require root (this is a non-root application, but if you have root you don't need a computer to install!)Note: you'll need to use your computer to re-install the app every time you reboot your device.A selection of some five star reviews:Karlo Valerio on Apr 29: At first, I was a little sketchy, probably because I'd tried almost every other no-root method of video recording for android, and some were even more expensive than this one (yes, I waste money). So imagine how sceptical I was when I saw that you just follow the step by step instructions all the way through, and wow. I was amazed by how little lag there is in the recordings. I'm using my unrooted Nexus 5, and this works pretty much flawlessly for me.Jakov Pavic on Apr 25: I love this app. Doesn't lag and don't need root. Thank you very much for the app.Josh Jones on Mar 22: Just saw the update of this and tried it out. The quality is good, the fps is incredible when on no limit but the only potential problems are the power of your device, which can hinder your Max fps, and the amount of storage it can take up. Otherwise, a real gem like I said when I reviewed the previous version of this. If you're looking for a screen recorder, this is the one to have.Jacob Rook on Mar 3: I am running a non-rooted device and this app works amazingly! Ive been looking for screen recorders that dont require root and a lot of them make you download all this stuff then end up not even working. I give this app 5 stars! Thank you so much for developing it!Caleb Swanson on Feb 26: I have been searching for a no root screen recorder forever and I finally found it! Its so easy to do! And I bet there are people complaining that you have to connect your device to the computer but they give you a step by step tutorial that takes about five minutes! Trust me its not a waste! Thanks SOOOOO much for making this!Nick Wolf on Feb 5: The best recorder that does not require root. Other apps do not really work or dont work at all.For a comparison of Android screen recorders see: http://recordable.mobi/compareFree demo version available from http://recordable.mobi/freeFollow Recordable on Google+ and YouTubehttp://plus.google.com/+RecordableMobiApp/postshttp://www.youtube.com/user/RecordableMobiTags: grabar pantalla, bildschirm aufnehmen, aufzeichnungs, mp4.

This means for example that you cannot use a European device with an American, Middle Eastern, Asian, ... , SIM card. You'd still be able to use the European SIM all over the world, but you would not be able to use a local SIM card while travelling outside of Europe - which would of course be much cheaper. Sammy claims you can use any SIM card in the world after you've 'activated' with a SIM card from the region the device is from (in our example, Europe), but this has been proven by various (angry) Note 3 owners to not actually be the case.The region lock is implemented in the form of a network blacklist. Beware that this is not exactly the same thing as a SIM lock, even though they are somewhat related. This blacklist blocks a number of whole countries and carriers, while a SIM lock whitelists one specific carrier. This app clears the network blacklist (region lock), but it may or may not remove the SIM lock, if present. Some have reported it works for them (for example: T-Mobile US Note3 on AT&T network: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2471742 ), but this should be considered a side-effect.While removing the region lock does not necessarily affect the SIM lock, various users have reported that inputting a proper SIM unlock code does remove the region lock as well. You can purchase SIM unlock codes at various places on the internet for 20 bucks or so. A benefit of using such a code is that you do not need to root your device or use this app. If you are not rooting your device already for other reasons, I would personally not root it to just region unlock, and buy an unlock code instead.Compatible devices- Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9005 (MI7, MJ1, MJ3 firmwares)FutureRight now, this has only been tested on Note 3's, and found working. Rumor has it Sammy will be bringing the region lock to a lot of devices, even backporting it to devices sold in the past (aren't there laws against this?). There's no way for me to know at this time if this specific method will keep working on the Note 3, or if it will work at all on other devices. Maybe the app will need updating, maybe Sammy will block this hack altogether, etc. Only time will tell.In theory this hack can be done without rooting or voiding warranty with some device flashing and app modding, but I'm not currently working on that because it would be highly model-specific and I'm a root user anyway.RelapseIt is not currently known exactly when the network blacklist is updated. Beware that for example updating your firmware may cause the region lock to reactivate.Why is this paid ?You're pretty much just buying me (half) a beer. If you do not want or are not able to pay, you can get this app for free at XDA: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2470551 . Region unlocking only takes about a minute, so if it doesn't work for you, you should also have more than enough time to refund the app as well.

Enable Calendar and Night mode, and forget about having to play with volume control to silence your phone. Several features set this app apart from others in the category. This application was written with security in mind. As such, it requires just a few permissions to read user's contacts, calendar and to send and receive SMS. Most other apps require network permissions, and some need access to SD storage, which allows them to transfer any of the personal data from the phone unnoticed. This app can't do that, so you can rest assured that your personal data is safe. This app offers a lot more than Do Not Disturb Mode on the iPhone or Samsung\u2019s Blocking Mode:* It can silence the phone for the night and/or during office hour, meetings or calendar appointments* Instant silent mode timer can be started with just 1 click* It can keep the phone on silent + vibrate all day and go completely silent for the night* It mutes phone calls and all audible notifications during quiet time, except alarms* Day and night time schedule can be programmed separately for each day of the week* Calendar selection is configurable, and only Busy events are muted* SMS and call exceptions are supported while the phone is muted* You can allow separate groups of contacts to ring at night and/or during the day* Enable Emergency mode to let repeated calls from the same number ring* Use No Exceptions mode to block calls from allowed contacts for the duration of an important meeting* Use Respond via SMS to let the caller know to call back again if it's urgent* Optionally disable Bluetooth handsfree during quiet time* Cancel mute when you wake up early or the meeting ends earlyCertain Samsung phones have issues with vibrate mode. If your phone doesn't vibrate when you enable vibration in this Do Not Disturb app, change vibration settings in your phone's system settings/sounds menu.Note that if you have a task killer/booster type of app installed on your device, add this Do Not Disturb app to the list of exceptions. Also, make sure you don't have other apps that manipulate the speaker running at the same time.Recent reviews:AndroidCentral -  http://www.androidcentral.com/apps-week-sorcery-crazy-taxi-imsa-and-moreAndroidPit - http://www.androidpit.com/do-not-disturb-blocking-modeTwitTv - http://twit.tv/show/all-about-android/162This app was previously called Silence Scheduler Premium.

{"title": "Seeder", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=LCIS", "rating": "4.457746505737305", "Description": " Lag reduction for ROOT USERS ONLY!Many Android tasks run slower than they should for one simple, yet not-so-obvious reason: they consume large amounts of random data from a limited source.  Random data is used to generate session keys and unique identifiers, in SSL and wifi, while starting processes, and during inter-process communication.This data (entropy) runs out frequently, and that causes processes reading from the blocking device (if any) to temporarily stop responding (lag).  These processes cannot continue until the Linux kernel repopulates the entropy pool, which takes time.  In addition, input events are pulled from the user interface (to refill the pool), which may also contribute to the problem.Seeder is a service for root users.  It assists the kernel in \"topping off\" the entropy pool by re-seeding it with data from the non-blocking (high performance) random device.  Optionally, it can also help alleviate MMC I/O contention by extending the I/O queue, allowing the I/O scheduler to make better decisions, and combine more writes.On some devices, applications load significantly faster (particularly large ones like Facebook, Chrome, and Youtube), and task switching becomes effortless.  Fewer visual \"hiccups\" occur.You MUST be running a rooted device to use this application!  If you don't know what this means, Seeder will probably not work on your device!** Note **This app does not increase raw performance, but rather eliminates some types of annoying lag (ie. applications briefly freezing, jerky scrolling, delays returning to the home screen, etc).  The effect seems to be more noticeable the longer the device has been running prior to activating the RNG service.Google's efforts to optimize newer builds of Android have been substantial, and Seeder has less effect on Android 4.0+ (though many users still report improvement).Bug reports are greatly appreciated.  If you have any trouble with the application, please send an email before leaving a review.  If during testing you find that Seeder does not noticeably reduce lag on your device, please email me for a refund!

Samsung Galaxy devices from 2013 and onward are unlikely to work correctly. Examples are Galaxy Note 10.1, Galaxy MEGA, Galaxy S 4, Galaxy Note 2, and Galaxy Note 3. This is because of KNOX.LG devices will be fully unrooted, but will still say \"Rooted\" afterwards because of LG's eFuse. Simply hit the 'UNROOT' button and allow Root Access when asked to give it permission. The device will then reboot and you will be completely Unrooted when you boot back up.****WHEN APP DOES NOT REBOOT AFTER ALLOWING ROOT, CLOSE THE APP AND HIT UNROOT AGAIN****This is a great app for those who are trying to complete a warranty return with a carrier for a defective device hardware or a repair. If you only want to temporarily lose Root Access, this app is not for you. Unrooting is permanent and cannot be undone with this app. Only use this if you truly want to lose Root Access.If your device has an Insecure Kernel (Boot.img) the app will now tell you and close. This is for users who could not bother to read the App Description that warns you that if your device has an Insecure Kernel, it will NOT fully unroot you. Insecure Kernel (Boot.img) means that unless your Kernel (Boot.img) is brought back to the factory stock file, your device will never be unrooted fully, so this app will no longer bother attempting to try, only to get users complaining about not being able to OTA.Please be aware, this app does not gurantee that it will fix your specific devices \"Over-The-Air Update\" issues. In most cases, anything you did with root such as: Debloating, Installing a custom Kernel, custom ROM, custom Recovery (like TWRP or Clockworkmod), enabling tether, etc. will NOT be un-done by this app. If you can't update because your system was modified, look for a way to flash back the entire device, such as Odin for Samsung.You can see a video explaining this by \"zedomaxx\" on youtube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdlIxE7K_vwSupport for x86, ARM, and MIPS devices.Support for ChainsDD Superuser, Chainfire SuperSu, and Koush Superuser.REVIEWS:Featured on Droid-Life! - http://www.droid-life.com/2013/04/11/new-app-claims-to-unroot-any-android-device-with-a-single-tap/Featured on Phandroid! - http://phandroid.com/2013/04/11/universal-unroot/Featured on AndroidFanNetwork! - http://androidfannetwork.com/2013/04/11/one-click-unroot-app-for-any-android-device/Featured on Frandroid! - http://www.frandroid.com/applications/136681_universal-unroot-pour-desactiver-le-root-dun-seul-clic#more-136681Featured on GetNews JPN! - http://getnews.jp/archives/320358Tomsgt123 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySNStU8OTukDroidModd3rX - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_viwAMoIcJMtmyinc - http://www.droidrzr.com/index.php/topic/15295-universal-unroot-app/SEO: root, unroot, superuser, SuperSU, rooted, hide root  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.universal.unroot", "price": "EGP7.00", "date_published": "December 29, 2013", "email": "mattlgroff@gmail.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "category": "Tools", "developer": "Batakang", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://batakang.com/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHFcxokVzOuORDeKfy_-wbdx5wp1w", "reviewers": "291"}

{"title": "SignalCheck Pro", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Blue+Line+Computing", "rating": "4.716463565826416", "Description": " SignalCheck allows users to check the true signal strength of their connections. Unlike the standard Android signal bars, which typically only display the 1xRTT (voice and low-speed data) signal strength, SignalCheck will show you detailed signal information about all of your device's connections, including 1X, GSM, EV-DO or eHRPD (3G), LTE (4G), and Wi-Fi.Special thanks to S4GRU for their tremendous support of SignalCheck from the beginning! Visit http://www.S4GRU.com for up-to-the-minute information and discussions about Sprint's Network Vision strategy, as well as talk about devices and other cellular networks. There is a SignalCheck discussion thread too!SignalCheck will display LTE Cell ID information on many HTC devices, as well as some devices by other manufacturers running Android 4.2 or higher. SignalCheck was one of the first (if not THE first) Android apps to provide this information to users.A configurable SignalCheck widget can be added to your home screen, showing your realtime connection type and signal strengths.SignalCheck also displays the current connection type along with the carrier name, or the System ID of the carrier if roaming.One of the best features of SignalCheck are the notification icon(s). A user-customizable icon shows your data connection strength in the notification area at the top of the screen, and more details can be seen in the pulldown menu. Your signal strength is always at the top of the screen along with your other icons.. no need to open the app to check your connections. The icons are customizable, showing signal bars, connection type, digital signal strength in dBm, or connection type with signal strength. A secondary icon can be enabled to always display the 1xRTT signal for users who wish to compare their signal strengths realtime. All of this is customizable from within the app! Users can configure this to automatically start when their device boots up if they choose to.SignalCheck can also notify the user with optional audio and/or vibrating alerts when a 4G LTE connection is discovered. This is handy for users traveling in new cities, or if your carrier's network is being upgraded -- know immediately when you have a high-speed connection! Sprint users can also enable alerts to notify them when they connect to 800MHz SMR.Curious as to which tower you are connected to? SignalCheck will not only show you the ID, but also the street address of the 1X tower or sector on most CDMA networks! Clicking on the address will automatically show the location through your mapping app. Please note, this feature is provider-dependent, as some (Verizon Wireless) block the location information, and others (Sprint) offset the location by a short distance to indicate which sector you are on. Location information is also not available for GSM-based networks.SignalCheck has an option to quickly reset your data connections from within the app (root required on Android 4.2+). Another option allows users to start checking their signals as soon as their device boots, enabling the notification icon(s) immediately.SignalCheck provides easy access to advanced Android screens such as Data, Debug, Engineering, EPST, and Field Trial, along with Battery Info, Field Trial, Mobile Networks, and Wi-Fi info. These screens are already available on most Android devices, but are only accessible by special dialer codes.SignalCheck is a great compliment to the Sensorly app, allowing you to check your signal strengths and map them out so other users can see the data as well.This app has also been referred to as Signal Check, Signal Check LTE, LTE Signal Check, and LTE Checker, among other things. Users checking their signals on the Sprint network will see the most benefit from this app as their Network Vision nationwide upgrade rolls out, but Boost, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and international users can also check their signals and see detailed information about their connections.

VideoVault hides these videos from public view until you choose to reveal them.Privacy and DiscretionIt's a reality of life. Sometimes you're unaware that someone is messing around with your phone.

Once you do, browse through your entire video collection through this application. Choose which videos you wish to protect with VideoVault. You select a video by long-pressing it.

{"title": "Screebl - Total Screen Control", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=keyeslabs.com", "rating": "4.426110744476318", "Description": " Get your Screen on!  Screebl is an application that controls your screen based on orientation.  It's better than SmartStay and it works on any phone, not just Samsung.  Never have the screen turn off again while using your phone, and SAVE BATTERY too.  It's possible with Screebl!Screebl works based on a simple observation:  we generally hold our phones or tablets in roughly the same positions when we're using them.  Screebl uses the accelerometer in your mobile device to detect how you're holding your phone, and when your device is within a configurable range, the screen is kept on.  Move out of that range, and Screebl releases the lock and the screen is allowed to go off.  It sounds simple (and it is), but it works amazingly well!How does Screebl save power?  Well, it's simple.  On most phones, the screen is the single largest consumer of battery power.  With Screebl running you can reduce the average amount of time that your screen is on by only keeping it on when you're ACTUALLY using your phone.  The amount of savings can vary significantly by device and usage patterns, but it is possible for users to see savings of 20% or more.  See our web site for more details.REVIEWS\u2605 \"Screebl is ingenious...\"  -- KnowYourMobile.com\u2605 \"Screebl also helps you extend your battery life...\" -- AndroidAuthority.com\u2605 \"Screebl is a far more effective way to utilize our screen timeouts...\" -- Android Spin.com\u2605 \"Works out of the box...\" -- AndroidTap.com\u2605 \"Screebl offers an intelligent solution to the problem of screen control...\" -- AndroidGuys.com\u2605 \"Excellent customization...\" -- Phandroid.comPRO-ONLY FEATURES \u2713 PocketLock locks your phone when you put it into your pocket, unlocks when you take it out \u2713 AppExceptions let you turn Screebl off when selected apps are running in the foreground \u2713 Locale plug-in and Tasker integration provide automated control and customization of Screebl \u2713 Look-and-feel customization lets you make Screebl look the way YOU want \u2713 Better detection algorithms \u2713 Screen timeout set from ScreeblPERMISSIONSRECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Needed to a start Screebl when phone starts up.INTERNET - Needed to check for new instructional videos and submit debugging information.WAKE_LOCK - Needed to keep the screen on.WRITE_SETTINGS - Needed to update system settings related to screen timeouts.GET_TASKS - Needed to disable Screebl when selected apps are running (AppExclusions).CHECK_LICENSE - Needed to monetize pirated versions of Screebl.READ_PHONE_STATE - Needed to check phone state (e.g., in-call, speakerphone on, etc.) to provide in-call behavior (e.g., disable Screebl or lock screen on)KNOWN ISSUES \u2713 Some phones do NOT deliver sensor events when the screen is off.  Examples include some HTC phones, some Sony Xperia phones, and quite a few Motorola phones.  PocketLock may not work properly on these phones.  See this link for more info:  http://www.saltwebsites.com/2012/android-accelerometers-screen-off \u2713 PocketLock causes significant battery drain on some phones.  The effect of the PocketLock feature varies widely from one phone to another.  The longer that you have PocketLock monitor for removal from your pocket, the more power will be used.  Most phones see a minor increase in power consumption when using PocketLock (4-8%). \u2713 Stillness detection doesn't detect small movements on some devices.  A few devices have very coarse-grained accelerometers, and as such movement is not detected well, causing stillness timeouts when the phone is actually being used.  I am working on a fix for this that will be in an upcoming release.  Most phones are fine. \u2713 Screebl doesn't startup when the phone is powered-on.  On some phones (HTC in particular) the \"fastboot\" capability can cause problems with Screebl being started at power-on.  I've done my best to fix this, but it still is a problem on some HTC devices.  Also, Screebl must NOT be moved to SD storage.

The effective distance is 10m-1km. To measure the distance, you should know the height(width) of a target.Don't worry!! Man's height is 1.7m(5.6ft), a golf flag is 7ft, a bus is 3.2m(10.5ft), a door is 2.1m(7ft). With that, we can guess the height(width) of almost everything.If you know the airplane model, you can measure the height from the sky. For reference, Boeing 747's width is 72 meters.Usage is simple. Input the height of the target, and touch the screen. If the target is aligned by 2 lines, get the measured distance.* Now, 3 tools for distance were completed.1) Smart Ruler (Short, touch) : 1-50cm 2) Smart Measure (Medium, trigonometry) : 1-50m3) Smart Distance (Long, perspective) : 10m-1kmSpeed Gun's Usage is also easy. It can measure the speed of a moving object by touch (speedometer, velocimeter).To measure the speed, input the closest distance to the target, and touch the screen following target. If yours is inaccurate, you can calibrate with the [Speed Calibration].For more information, see the manual, Youtube video and the blog.

{"title": "Gravity Screen Pro - On/Off", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Plexnor", "rating": "4.476502895355225", "Description": " Install it only if you have difficulty to Unlock the Free version by In-app Purchase.  If you have purchased this app and want to change to the Unlocked version:- unlock the Free version by In-app Purchase- send me the two purchase numbers or the two receipts you got from Google Play- and I'll refund the purchase of the Pro version Using your phone often? Tired of the On-Off switching?This app turns automatically your screen off when you put your phone into your pocket or onto a table and turn the screen on when you take it out or up. No need to touch any button and you are ready to go. It's also helpful if your side button does not work.HOW TO UNINSTALL?Use the UNINSTALL button in the app.HOW IT WORKSIt monitors the orientation of the device through the gravity sensor. When your phone is pointing downward by its top, below a certain angle, it's likely to be out of use. In this situation the proximity sensor is activated to determine if it is covered. If yes, the screen turns off because probably you placed the phone into your pocket or onto a table. To keep the battery usage low the program turns on the proximity sensor only when it's really necessary. Moreover, when it turns your screen off and the proximity sensor is covered it puts your phone into deep sleep state to save as much energy as possible.MAIN FEATURES- Pocket Sensor: Recognizes if your phone is in your pocket. - Table Sensor: Detects your phone is lying on a table and turns the screen off.- Turn Screen On by Motion: If the screen is off and it's facing up the device can be woken up by any movements, for example lift up by hand.- Keep Screen On by Motion:It keeps the screen on by relying on the small movements you are doing by your hand while holding the phone. If small motions are detected while the screen is facing up the feature keeps the screen on because it can be suspected that the phone is held and probably you are reading something. If the phone is steady the normal screen timeout will apply in any position you leave your device.- Tasker, Llama, Locale supported by plug-in.BATTERY USAGEIt should be not significant. I experienced about 6 per cent extra consumption on the test device. However it can be much higher by often using the Turn Screen On by Motion feature. Thus, keep your phone face down if you want to save energy.IMPORTANTOn some devices (e.g. HTC One) the alarm clock is switched off by the app after it had gone off! Please check if it's the case for you. If, yes, use a third party app, for example: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vp.alarmClockPlusDockFAQQ: The screen not always turns off when I put my phone into my pocket, why?A:The proximity sensor not always accurate. It can fail recognizing some materials specially if they are very close to it. If it happens to you often, you can activate the False Turn-On Protection feature which effectively reduces the number of accidental wake-ups.Q: I'm experiencing high battery usage, why?A: The app should use about 6 percent extra energy per day if you are not using too much the Turn Screen On by Motion feature, for example keeping your phone face down when it's on a table. Moreover, please, keep in mind that the android en-built battery consumption measurement can show much higher results if it's based on a short period of time.More FAQs : http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2227516  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexnor.gravityscreenoffpro", "price": "EGP12.75", "date_published": "April 12, 2014", "email": "gravityscreen@gmail.com", "downloads": "5,000 - 10,000", "category": "Tools", "developer": "Plexnor", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.2 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t%3D2227516&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNG1utL9fy7pBs7dtYY8LKzUg9xvjQ", "reviewers": "915"}

{"title": "Watchdog Task Manager", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Zomut,+LLC", "rating": "4.549220085144043", "Description": " Stop killing your apps randomly. Start monitoring them with Watchdog. You don't need a task killer. But you do need a way to make sure a background app doesn't lose control and eat up all your CPU.  Watchdog monitors your apps and alerts when one loses control, allowing you to kill just that single app. Killing apps blindly can cause them to stop working as designed, and most app developers won't even take a bug report from you if you are using a task killer!From Android 2.2 on, the kill command works only on background apps, and they will likely restart immediately. Watchdog removes the app immediately from the list, since there isn't feedback about whether it was successful. Having lots of apps running doesn't hurt your phone at all unless they are doing something. In fact, killing an app and having it immediately restart simply consumes your phones resources. If you just leave the apps running, they will start immediately when you want to go back to it.The paid version has all the features of the lite, removing the ads, while adding a \u201cblacklist\u201d feature. This allows you to pick a single app that is constantly misbehaving and assign a CPU % threshold to it. When that app exceeds the threshold, it will be automatically killed.So stop blindly killing all your apps; be smart by managing them instead. Good for all versions of Android.NOTE: There is an Android issue where Watchdog might crash upon launching after an upgrade. It seems to be related to the upgrade of the app while the old version happens to be executing in the background. It doesn't affect your phone's operation at all. If this happens, re-launch and goto the menu and hit restart for proper monitoring.

{"title": "Force2SD [root]", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Omega+Centauri+Software", "rating": "4.24404764175415", "Description": " This app needs a rooted device that supports moving apps to SD.  Use at your own risk.  For a free trial, download the lite version.Save precious application storage!  Force2SD lets you force many apps to move to SD card/external storage even when the system would not allow you to move them, thereby saving space in the app storage area.  While Android as of version 2.2 introduced the feature that lets you move apps to SD card/external storage, it normally only allows the movement of applications explicitly marked by the developer as movable.  Force2SD moves many applications not marked as movable.You can also move applications back, and sort alphabetically or by apk size.  By default (you can turn this off) Force2SD will also scan for orphan app files on your SD card when starting. Sometimes, the system fails to delete the app file on the SD card when the app is uninstalled. If any orphan files are found, you will be asked if you want to delete them. This may help with some reboot issues.Note 1: Applications moved to SD card / external storage will not get an on-boot signal when the device is booted up.    So, do not move applications that need to perform some operations on boot.  Of course, you should always be able to move these applications back if you're having problems.  As a bonus, if you don't want an application starting up on boot, you can use Force2SD to move it.Note 2: After a reboot, it make take a while (even a couple of minutes) for the OS to show up the icons of apps that have been moved.  That is normal--that's how the OS's apps-on-SD feature works.Note 3: Some protected apps cannot move.Note 4: The first time you start the app, it will do a slower scan of applications.

If you bought Unlock With WiFi in the last two months, please contact me and I will either refund your purchase or give you a free copy of SkipLock. You don't *have* to switch to SkipLock. If you are happy with Unlock With WiFi, stick with it. It will still be supported.For a full explanation of why SkipLock was created, see this blog post: http://benhirashima.com/posts/the-rebirth-of-unlock-with-wifi/This app is NOT the unlock key for SkipLock. Do not buy this app if you want to use SkipLock.Tired of entering your password every time you turn on your phone? Unlock With WiFi\u2122 unlocks your phone when you're connected to your home WiFi network. When you're at home, or work, you don't need to worry about losing your phone, so why should you have to enter your password?Unlock With WiFi is the leading password convenience app on the market. It's focus is on reliability, quality, and a great user experience. The setup wizard makes it easy to setup, and helpful dialogs are displayed if something isn't quite right.How it works:When you get home and connect to your WiFi network, your device will unlock. Then when you leave, and the WiFi disconnects, the device will lock again. You have to enter your password the first time after you connect to your WiFi network. This is so that if someone steals or finds your phone, they can't just bring it to your house to unlock it. After you enter your password once while connected to your WiFi network, you won't have to enter it again until you leave/disconnect. This is great for SMS texting!Additional Features:You can also set a lock delay, for when you're not at home. The default delay is set to 5 seconds (you can adjust it), so when you turn the screen off, the device won't lock until 5 seconds have passed. That way, if you remember something you forgot to do, you can turn it back on without entering your password. This feature is considered experimental at this time. It works on most devices, but isn't guaranteed to work on all devices.There are also battery saving options to:    Turn off WiFi when you leave home    Turn on Bluetooth when you leave home    Turn off Bluetooth when you get home    Turn off Auto Sync when you leave home    Turn on Auto Sync when you get home    WidgetLocker integration If you have trouble with this app, please email me.  Don't give me a bad review until I have a chance to help you get it working! Send an email with Unlock With WiFi in the subject to unlockwithwifi@benhirashima.com.

Please, read the description completely! ****-------GLTools is a custom OpenGL driver (proxy), that is compatible with any known OpenGLES 2.0-compatible GPU + ARM processor, x86 processors are not supported (Galaxy Tab 3 for example). If you still don't understand, what this app is, the closest known analog is Chainfire3D.Features list:- Change resolution and rendering bitness in any app, even if it doesn't support that by default.- Change GPU name and enjoy enhanced graphics even on a noname low-end GPU.- Take full control over textures: now you can decompress/recompress them (even if your GPU doesn't support that texture format) and resize. Note that decompression feature is available only if you'll install a plugin (internet is required to do that)- Optimize shaders on-the-fly for optimal performance (the same optimizer is used in Unity3D engine by default)- Enable MSAA or CSAA in any app to improve graphics quality (make sure that your GPU supports that)- Measure gained performance with a nice onscreen FPS counter (or you can output FPS information to Logcat if you are a pro)GLTools is 100% safe if you have a custom recovery installed (and you didn't disable backup in GLTools install dialog), if you'll find it non-working, you can just flash uninstall_gltools.zip in recovery and email me with details (or request a refund).Tested on:- HTC One X- Nexus 7 2013- LG G2Failed on:- Some Samsung devices (random).

If it doesn't work now, it's an issue with your handset's firmware that is almost certainly not fixable from the app's side.  This whole program is more of a hack than anything else - the function is clearly not officially supported by Google.  I can't guarantee that it will work for any given phone and/or BT headset.Simple app to stream audio to your bluetooth mono headset.  Requires Android 2.2 or higher. Tested on stock HTC Evo 4G ROM (2.2) and CM7 RC1.  Leave feedback and ask questions at http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=950472Features:- Change your Android's color- Auto restart after phone call- Widget!!- Automatically enable Bluetooth on app launch (user can still choose not to allow this).  Make sure your headset is actually CONNECTED before hitting 'On.'- In-app 'Media Volume' control.  Adjust the 'Bluetooth In-Call Volume' using the physical buttons on your phone or headset.- Ongoing Status Bar notification while the program is running.- Automatic turn on at app launch available via Menu-->Preferences.  Note - if enabled your headset must be connected before running BTmono.- ICS (Android 4.0) support including use of Holo theme.- Limited Skype support (if enabled after call is started). Please note - microphone routing is not possible on Samsung phones and may not be possible on GSM phones - sorry.Notes:- Make sure your headset is connected BEFORE clicking 'On'- To use with Skype you must enable BTmono AFTER starting a Skype call.  Microphone routing does not appear to be possible on Samsung phones (without some ugly hacks, at least) because of Samsung's efforts to prevent phone call recording. Microphone routing may also be impossible on GSM phones due to API limitations.  Please don't rate the program lowly due to this - Skype support is not the point of this app!- To reduce static, set the 'Media Volume' slider to max and reduce the 'Bluetooth In-Call Volume' via your phone/headset. - This version contains a workaround for a bug in Android 2.2 which causes a system crash under certain circumstances. If you are on 2.2, do NOT disable Bluetooth while the stream is running or your phone WILL reboot (sorry - tell your phone manufacturer to move to 2.2.1+).To-do:- Auto turn on BT when widget is activated.- Volume sliders for audio streams other than 'Media'- Possible - map headset button to user-definable action.- Other features?

Come si usa l'applicazione? Si avvia l'applicazione, posizionandosi in situazioni dove puo' essere ricevuto normalmente un segnale GPS (pu\u00f2 accadere anche dentro casa ma \u00e8 pi\u00f9 difficile), e cio\u00e8 all'aperto e possibilmente in movimento in modo che i satelliti possano triangolare. A quel punto \u00e8 sufficiente attendere qualche istante per vedere i primi satelliti che vengono ricevuti, rilevati alcuni satelliti se non vi sono difetti hardware o software il chip gps effettua il fix. A questo punto si pu\u00f2 mandare in background l'applicazione e aprire un software navigatore o ad esempio Google Maps. Tutto ci\u00f2 avviene solitamente in pochi secondi come da gli esempi qui sotto di alcuni utenti soddisfatti, e altri che hanno documentato il loro feedback nel forum o nel market.

At this point you can send in the background the application and open a browser or software such as Google Maps.All this is usually done within a few seconds as the examples below of some satisfied users, and others who have documented their feedback on the forum or in the market.A few examples:carlo.ldp: Galaxy S - fix in 10 seconds with 8 satellitespisudaniel: Galaxy Ace - fix in 5 seconds with 11 satellitespisudaniel: O1 - fix in 5 seconds with 9 satellitesschwarzerkreuz: Galaxy Mini - fix in 2 minutes with 8 satellitesTDA: Galaxy S2 - fix in 1 minute with 11 satellitesSecutor: Galaxy S2 - fix in 40 seconds with 8 satellitesTiwiz: LG Dual - fix in 50 seconds with 8 satellitesgigi7: Galaxy S2 - fix in 20 seconds with 12 satellitespeppeuz: HTC Magic - fix in 9.16 seconds with 7 satellitesSometimes if the GPS has a cache that has made \"busting\" the GPS chip in the phone (eg some Galaxy S), it may be necessary or removal of a cache of GPS (where possible) or wait a little 'more time.At the time turns out to be the best application for FIX GPS on Android without the need for root privileges, or to make modifications to the phone.About all'introduizione graphics application I'm having some problems on the part of someone.

{"title": "Nuke My Device", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Avenger+Mobile", "rating": "3.8333332538604736", "Description": " Nuke My Device protects your privacy by secure deleting your personal data, such as photos and videos, making them unrecoverable. HOW IT WORKS First, Nuke My Device deletes everything on your internal SD card. Next, the app writes encrypted data to the entire partition, then wipes that data. The process repeats three times before triggering a factory reset. MORE INFORMATION Nuke My Device sanitizes your internal SD card by deleting everything and then filling the storage partition multiple times with encrypted data, ensuring none of your data remains on the partition. Android devices typically save pictures, downloads, documents, and other such personal data on the SD card.  For convenience, we offer you the option to receive an email receipt confirming when your internal SD card has been nuked as well as an easy way to initiate the factory reset. The entire process takes six simple steps: 1.\tDownload Nuke My Device.2.\tEnter email address for email confirmation after the nuke completes.3.\tStart nuking.4.\tWait.5.\tBegin prompted factory reset.6.\tRemove external SD card, if your device has one, before recycling or trade-in. Once you've completed the nuking process, your data is virtually unrecoverable.  Nuke My Device doesn't eradicate data from your external SD card, but that\u2019s okay because reusing your SD card in your new device will save you money! If your device has an external SD card, make sure to remove it before recycling or trade-in. Nuke My Device replaces the apps Nuke My Phone and Nuke My Tablet, providing you one app to erase your personal data from devices before they\u2019re ready for disposal. Note: Because some devices, specifically old ones, can take up to several hours for the nuking process, we recommend plugging in your phone or tablet before you start. We\u2019re aware that background processes from other apps and waiting for access to internal memory can at times cause the app to hang. If you think it\u2019s been hanging too long, exit the app, force close it, and begin again. If you\u2019re still having trouble, contact support at info@avengermobile.com. FAQs Q. Why should I nuke my phone or tablet?A. If you\u2019re planning to upgrade or have ever upgraded your phone or tablet, likely you've an old, unwanted device collecting dust at home. The traditional delete functionality in Android is vulnerable to recovery, so before tossing that device, you must nuke it to ensure your personal data is not compromised.\u2028 Q. Does Nuke My Device provide a secure wipe of my data?A. Yes, Nuke My Device completes a secure wipe of your internal SD card to ensure your device has been properly sanitized, leaving your data secure.\u2028 Q. What should I do with my old phone or tablet?A. Rather than letting it contribute to the clutter in your home, you can either recycle or trade in your device. Many recycling programs dispose of or refurbish old devices properly, protecting electronic information. You can check your carrier\u2019s trade-in policy, too, because some carriers will give you cash for your phone.\u2028 Q. Where can I recycle my old phone or tablet?A. Many organizations recycle unwanted mobiles, and most electronics dealers, such as Best Buy and Staples, participate in an electronic recycling program. Try searching by electronic device type on the EPA\u2019s Website http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/materials/ecycling/donate.html.\u2028 Q. The nuke took only a few seconds. Did it work?A. Depending on your device\u2019s specifications and amount of storage, the process might take only a few seconds to complete. Don\u2019t worry. If you\u2019ve been prompted to begin a factory reset, the nuke has occurred, and you\u2019re protected. Q. Does Nuke My Device offer remote wipe?A. Although Nuke My Device doesn't offer remote wipe at this time, we\u2019re considering this option for a future release.

If you use an app it will always reduce the battery life on all devices, especialy if use it permanently.But, thanks to Sonys last update the low power mode can be used on Sony SmartWatch 2 (SW2) now.So we maximized the battery lifetime for SmartWatch2.For SmartWatch 1 users here are some tips:The display of the Smart Watch decrease the battery life most, so we implemented two options for you:* \"Dim after 10 seconds\" to dim down the SmartWatch display after 10 seconds till you touch the display.* \"Stand by after 10 seconds\" to turns of the display after 10 seconds and will wake up after touching the display.So it is your choice how much energy you save.Question 3: Is it possible to display the battery level of the SmartWatch.Answer:No. There is no possibility to read out the battery sensor of the SmartWatch at this time.Smart extension for SmartWatch 2Smart Connect extension for SmartWatch 2LiveWare\u2122 extension for SmartWatchcustom clock for SmartWatch  ", "app_url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaybit.smartwatch.customwatch", "price": "EGP19.99", "date_published": "January 15, 2014", "email": "android@kaybit.com", "downloads": "10,000 - 50,000", "category": "Tools", "developer": "kaybit", "content_rating": "Everyone", "operating_system": "2.1 and up", "dev_website": "https://www.google.com/url?q=http://kaybit.com&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNG4NDWzGFIyJLjn1qVBF0SVB6HDPg", "reviewers": "465"}

Has been primarily developed for the Samsung Galaxy.It does not feel good to change the settings. But you want to change the settings?Regardless of whether or not you can call successfully on your models, this implements a lot of method of multiple calls which can call.(ShowServiceMode is specialized for the switching of LTE)Dial pad does not accept the input of secret code. However, there may be some cases where the function corresponding to the secret code that are present.In that case, Using ShowServiceMode, you can call the hidden screen.

{"title": "Radioactivity Counter", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=Rolf-Dieter+Klein", "rating": "4.348039150238037", "Description": " Radioactivity CounterThis is a real working radioactivity counter. You only need a BLACK TAPE to cover the lenses !! Disclaimer: The type of radiation picked up by the camera can be dangerous/detrimental to the user's health as well as cause damage to the device. Its NOT a JOKE! The App is using the camera sensor to detect radiation, like a geiger mueller counter, of course with a smaller area. We tested several mobile phones at the Helmholtz research facility in Munich, using a professional radiation device in the range of 2-10 \u00b5Gy/h till 1-10 Gy/h (CS137 and CO60). The CMOS sensors can detect primary gamma radiation and some higher beta radiation (depends on the shieldings in the mobile phone). Typically not going into saturation as most GM tubes. See FAQ on our homepage for what you can measure and how.PLEASE SEND US FEEDBACK via EMAIL !! We add new devices in short intervals.Attention: the tape must shield the light completely. Please check with a light source !On our homepage you find several measurement result for different devices we tested so far. Some are excellent, some not that sensitive. Feel free to use our table to assign radiation values to our counter measurements when you have the same device. The real values might differ as sensors can change. There we need your help and the help of the manufactures for a future calibration service.You can use the contact button in the help menu to provide us with feedback and please use it.If you need any help, PLEASE send us an email. We have cannot answer the comment section below, so please ask us first on measurment problems. We help as fast as possible. Please contact us on any problems you have with this application! Look at our videos, more are comming soon. Attention: The counts per minute (CPM) for the background noise should be low (increase the noise setting if not). This is camera noise not radiation noise basically. If the radiation increases then also counts from the radiation adds to the CPM values (see our tables for the sensitivity). If you have a phone with 200 CPM for 100 uGy/h then the background noise produces for 100 nGy/h only 0.1 CPM. That means in 10 minutes ONE counts in 100 minute TEN counts adding to the CPM0 (noise of sensor). So you need a LONG time to measure for low radiation values on this device. Attention: AM241 (smoke detectors) only emit ALPHA rays, they get stuck in the plastic of the phones. H3 (tritium - watches etc) are beta emitters with 45 keV. They also get stuck quickly, mainly already in the watches. K40 (KCL for example contains 16 Bq/g) are beta emitters with small amount of gamma (due to positron collisions)- you need also a long integration time to measure them.  Same for TH rods (2% Thorium) mainly alpha rays, then beta and some gamma. Very small diameter ! You need a large area to detect them (best GM with mica windows). The CMOS sensor of the camera only has 2mmx2mm.Good objects are TH lenses (up to 30% TH232), pitchblend (gamma of decay products) and CS137 for checking food which might be contaminated (if larger 1 uSv/h). Don't experiment with radiation sources !!!Features:* saving raw counter values in 3 different noise levels* saving temperature data* saving location (optional)* saving settings data* export by email (CSV) or file, CSV / HTML* export of mean values in Counts + standarddeviation* unit converter (Sievert, Gray, Rem...)We just released a comprehensive help on our homepage -- Important you NOISE value should be similar as in our tables, if it is too high check the tape to cover the lense - use multiple tapes if necessary and start calibration again !!!

The method how we achieve it is called polar alignment and it starts with a rough alignment of the RA axis. The best aid for this is to use a polar finder scope with a reticle. On the reticle the Polar star (and the Octant for the Southern hemisphere) is engraved and should be positioned over the real Polaris by turning it. Because the Polaris is not exactly coincide with the Earth's rotation axis but rotates around it, one should know the exact hour angle of the Polaris to adjust (rotate) the finder.This utility helps you solve this problem by graphically showing you the current position of the Polaris. The application tracks and draws the position of the Polaris (or Octant) in real-time and also displays its hour-angle, the local sideral time, current local time and the longitude of the place. The longitude can be entered manually or obtained using the built-in GPS. The view on the display can be mirrored to match the view in your polar finder scope.

Then it increases available memory, improves activity of the device, eventually minimizes battery consumption. Free Simple Task Killing tool, is this !It has been designed for even beginners of an intelligent-phone to handle intuitively !#Functions- Momentarily termination of tasks- Transition to a detail page of application- Transition to an uninstall pane of application- Displays a ratio of CPU occupation- Displays available memory- Displays a quantity of remainder of the battery- The ignore-list which is used for registering applications to be excluded or masked- Registers recommended applications into the ignore-list- Terminates both applications and STK itself#Features1. Non-resident software-Andriod2.3 or morePopular task-killing softwares are continuing to be activated, and consuming memories. However, STK goes on the other way !STK quits itself very fast just after terminating its action by a RETURN or HOME button.Task-killing function itself continues to be a permanent resident ? A nuisance, isn't it ?Such a contradictory feature shouldn't be implemented. Just for this reason STK has been designed like that.Especially, the following function would never be implemented now and in the future.One-tap-killing by using widgetAutomatic-killing by supervising the activity of an application in backgroundThough the paid STK has similar one-tap-killing function to an widget, but big difference is non-resident behavior that has been fulfilled by using a quite unique short-cut.The users of ICS or later (Android 4.0 or more), can use this function, just try it !2. Fastest operationThe operation getting a task list is very much faster than that of pre-installed other task-killing applications or task managers !3. Particular looks A ratio of CPU occupation, available memory, a quantity of remainder of the battery, are shown on a display. That isn't cool enough !?4. Manages active applicationsBy selecting a task from the task list pane, the management pane will appear, then you can uninstall an application or delete cache memory. Therefore you would never be bothered to open the application management pane.#Q&AQ. Want to kill application by one-toutch. Doesn't STK implement an widget ?A. An widget is always a resident, so STK does not implement it. Paid STK is equipped with a one-toutch killing function. (Android4.0 or more)Q. Even after terminating a application, however it immediately appears again. Why ?A. This is caused by the specification of Android OS. The pre-installed application which belongs to the configuration type,  that needs to be continuing activated such as Facebook, is structured to reboot automatically .  Any function can terminate operation of an application temporarily, but no function would be able to re-terminate such application that reboots itself even after terminated once.Q. Want STK that will not re-boot an application.A. STK's basic concept is not to implement a resident function, therefore STK has no plan to implement a supervisory function that requires an application to suppress self-reboot.Q. How to use the ignore-list ?A. Those applications registered in the ignore-list will disappear from the application list, which appears  after STK is activated.This means that STK ignores whether they are operating or not. In other words they have already been put outside of  STK's management.Such applications that need to be always activated as  \"An alarm clock\" and \"E-mail\", should not to be registered in the ignore-list to avoid a risk of terminating their operation.When add an application in the ignore-list, first tap its name in the application pane, then next pane will pop up, finally tap \"Add to ignore list\".

Unknown, but unsecured networks are also supported to be connected to. Additionally, one can define \"WIFI Zones\" based on the current radiocell, in which your WIFI hardware will automatically be activated.Leaving a Wifi Zone, Wifi Jumper will turn off WIFI hardware and saves energy. New cell-Ids for already defined Wifi Zones are added automatically while connected to a known WIFI.In order to save even more energy, you are able to define timezones in which the airplanemode will be automatically (de-)activated. The advantages are not limited to energy saving: no radiation and disturbance while sleeping. Wifi Jumper is the perfect solution for many minor issues, but in only one app. Note: Wifi Jumper uses android functionality that didn't support App2SD. We strongly recommend to make no use of App2SD!Wifi Jumper needs the following permissions (reason):- Location (determine position of WIFI Location on a map)- Telephony (gather system-id)- System utilities (autostart, airplanemode start/stop, WIFI start/stop)- Networking (license check, scan for networks und status)Note: Please give us a chance to improve Wifi Jumper.

Currently 6 sets of icons, though others may be added in the future.This provides additional icon themes for GSam Battery Monitor, and also includes Overlay Icon support allowing any icon to overlay the default battery icon.  The location and size of the overlay is fully adjustable, allowing you to place it in just the right location on your device.NOTE:  To configure the location and size of the overlay icon, open up this app, and select 'Configure Overlay Icon Location'1) Circle - Big Visible NumbersThis theme provides a larger more readable version of the default GSam Battery Monitor icon.2) Ice Cream Sandwich ThemeThis theme conforms to the standards for notifications in Ice Cream Sandwich (Google's latest version of Android).  Icons are supposed to be simple and white - Android then automatically dims the icon when in the notification bar.3) Plain White NumbersSimple white numbers on a transparent background with a small white drain indicator above the number4) ICS BlueSimple blue numbers using the ICS theme - this is great for using as the overlay icon as it cleanly matches the blue clock.5)  CM InspiredInspired by the CyanogenMod 10.1 default Circle Battery (but more readable), this theme fits in well with any Holo themed device.  It has a very smooth charging animation which can be somewhat memory and CPU intensive - so it may not play nicely with older devices.6)  Just NumbersBy popular request from HTC users, this theme simply has white numbers.  It works well as an overlay icon on top of the default HTC battery widget.  Shrink it down to fit inside the battery icon, and set Background to fully transparent.Once installed, you can configure the icon using the Battery Icon Theme preference in the GSam Battery Monitor preferences.  Open GSam Battery Monitor > Select Preferences > Battery Icon Theme > and choose one of the icons from the icon pack. These will be listed underneath the 'Get More Themes' link.For information about creating your own Icon Packs, see our blog.Permission Explanation:* android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW:  The icon pack enables the ability to overlay the default battery icon, thereby making the current % always visible.

{"title": "Stud Finder", "developer_link": "/store/apps/developer?id=mmess", "rating": "2.8717949390411377", "Description": " StudFinder brings the simplicity and effectiveness of a real stud finder tool to your device. This app uses your device's magnetometer to pinpoint metal studs, nails, or screws in wood studs located in or under the drywall in any wall. Perfect for hanging wall fixtures, pictures, shelves, etc. StudFinder operates in the same way as other hand-held stud finders: LED lights light up in sequence with proximity to stud when your device's magnetometer is directly over the stud. But StudFinder's built in algorithms are very much superior to other similar apps because it actually detects very subtle changes in the background magnetic fields to precisely pinpoint studs quickly and accurately.Here's how it works:1. Turn StudFinder on and adjust sensitivity to desired level.2. Hold your phone very steady at one orientation until the green LED lights up - this indicates a stable background magnetic field.3. Find the precise location of your phone's magnetometer by moving a small coin or other metal object around back of phone until the red LEDs light up in sequence.4. Hold phone very steady against wall until green LED lights up. Then move phone along wall in grid-like pattern until red LEDs light up in sequence - this indicates a nail under your magnetometer.5. Mark this spot, as there should be a stud directly under your magnetometer.Why pay $20 or more for another tool when you can get StudFinder on your phone now? StudFinder also has ten sensitivity settings to ensure the perfect detection level for all situations, drywall thicknesses, or nail and screw depths, an optional beeper, and a magnetometer sensor check to ensure Stud Finder will work optimally on your device.Thank you all so much for your downloads, feedback, and reviews.

You must also have Sliding Emoji Keyboard installed for this to work.PLEASE READ: --- If you don't read it, it will be very obvious to us and we WILL NOT be willing to help you. You have been warned. --- This is a standalone keyboard that we have created with our app Sliding Messaging Pro. It is baked into that app, so there is no need to download here if you are only using it for that app, but we wanted to add it for anyone to use, even if you don't support us through that app. This keyboard only supports Google's new Google+ emojis, the ones in their hangouts app.NOTE: This app will NOT actually show the emojis in the text box or on the device unless your system supports them! Please understand this! We have no way to add support for that from this app. If you would like to get that working, you will have to have a rooted phone and change the system font to one that supports Google's emojis.Even though it doesn't show them correctly in the text boxes, when you send the message/tweet/email or whatever you are using it for, they will show up correctly, again as long as the app supports Google's new emojis. The recipient will receive them fine as well, as long as their phone has emoji support. They will be received fine on any iOS devices and any messaging app for Android that supports them. Almost all do by now.To actually see the emojis in the app, you will have to install an app that supports them. Examples of this would be: Sliding Messaging Pro, WhatsApp, Hangouts, and many more, you will have to find out yourself if the app you want to use our keyboard with supports them. --- How to Enable/Use --- To enable the \"Sliding Emoji Keyboard\", go to Settings -> Language & Keyboard, then check the \"Sliding Emoji Keyboard\" to enable it.To use \"Sliding Emoji Keyboard\", you need to change the input method: - In Android 2.3 and below, select \"Sliding Emoji Keyboard\" from the dialog that comes up after long pressing on any text box. - In Android 4.0 and above, drag down the notification tray when a text box is selected, then select \"Sliding Emoji Keyboard\" after switching the input method. --- REMEMBER ---As I said above, you won't be able to see all the emojis on the device! Sometimes they will show up as a blank space and usually they will show up as aiona black and white image of the selected emoji. THIS IS FINE. THEY WILL SEND CORRECTLY to all your friends that have support for them (again, iOS users and any Android messaging apps that have the emojis in them).Please don't just rate it one star because you can't see the images. I have explained it to you, so there are really no excuses for this.Thank you for reading, and if you didn't, remember that we will not be very willing to help or support you.Credit to Andreas Stuetz for his PagerSlidingTabStrip!

Battery drain varies by device type and can still be an issue on some devices.POWER OFF OPTIONSUsing Power On Volume you can power off the screen, lock the screen, and enter power saving sleep mode using three options:* Waving your hand in front of your device\u2019s proximity sensor (if supported).* Long pressing the search button (on devices with a search key).* Pressing a Power Off shortcut icon from your home screen.* Pressing the Power Off button in the Power On Volume app.* Pressing a Power Off notification in the notification bar.The long press search button feature is fully configurable. You can enable and disable this feature, and you can also select other apps to be launched when you long press the search button if they support this feature (such as the Google Voice Search app).The Power Off shortcut icon can be selected from 16 beautiful HD Power Off icons.The Power Off feature is compatible with all current versions of Android. Unlike many other apps available, the Power Off function will never turn the screen back on unpredictably like other similar apps are known to do when run on Android OS versions 4.0.4 or 4.1.1. When the Power Off Proximity function is enabled (on supported hardware), you can turn off your device by waving your hand in front of the proximity sensor or by placing your device face down, putting it in a pocket, etc. Any action that covers the front will turn off your device.

This application will ultimately be useless to you if you use Sense 6 launcher or Blinkfeed as your default launcher! This application was built for users to have the ability to use a 3rd party launcher and BlinkFeed at the same time.Quotes from Flip installers\"The best of both worlds\"\"Made my week\"\"Puts Nova Launcher's swipe to shame and brings it to any launcher\"\"Brings Blinkfeed to the Google launcher easily!\"\"One of the first apps you should install to your M8\"In HTC Flip for Blinkfeed, the application allows a user to use a 3rd party launcher like Google Now Launcher, Apex, ADW, Trebuchet, Xperia Z2 and more launchers from the Play Store and with a swipe of the home button or by simply pressing a shortcut, Blinkfeed will appear instantly. This application does not install Blinkfeed to your device! **User Tips**Sense Launcher feature add-on (Flip) allows launching Blinkfeed  with a single swipe motion. Calibrate the Sense Launcher by deleting all launcher screens leaving Blinkfeed by itself so, when you Flip, Blinkfeed acts as an add-on to your current default launcher. In order for a user to take advantage of swiping, Swipe up on home must be enabled in Display settings on the M7. Once done, Swipe up from home and replace the Google Now gesture with Blinkfeed! We take advantage of Google Now's home assist action provider.For the M8, Its as easy as swiping up from the lockscreen or holding the Home button in your navbar. **Community**If you have an idea of how we could improve, let us know!

Manual fix options are also available, including: forcing XTRA injection, forcing time injection, and clearing aiding data (all, almanac, ephemeris, time, position, UTC, ionospheric, health, SV Dir, SV Steer, SA, RTI, and CellDBInfo).This app has been tested an verified to work on the Galaxy S line of phones as well as many HTC and Motorola devices.  It is generic enough that it should work on EVERY available phone now. GPS Doctor is constantly improving, so please provide feedback if you use this app on another device.

Now you can!!With Hovering Controls you can use your phone just like Samsung Galaxy S4 does with Air Gesture and much more!HOW TO UNINSTALL IF YOU ENABLED ADMIN:App menu-->Device Admin Options-->Disable then uninstallFree limited version available for test!Email me if any error happens!Hovering Controls uses the proximity sensor of your device to register simple motions performed in front of your device. Predetermined apps can be launched by either hovering over the sensor, swiping once, or swiping twice. Silencing an alarm or ringtone is as simple as a hand wave. You can also control your media playback this way, allowing you to change to the next or previous song or video without ever turning on the phone screen and physically touching it.Do you like Quick Glance from Galaxy S4? Now you can have it too!!And that is not all, you can lock/unlock your phone, answer calls, slide betwen photos in your gallery and scroll up/down in your browser!! (browser scroll and gallery slides need a rooted device)Two modes are available, both offering a different take on opening apps:    Target mode: open a pre-determined app with a set gesture    Carousel mode: open up apps from a set list of appsThe app uses proximity sensor, use test sensor in menu to test your sensor sensibility and finde how you have to wave for it to detect. If you decide to hide notification icon, the service may stop working if android needs memery resources (it will stop detecting events ) for a while until it is restarted by its own.Music Controls How-To:1.- Start Hovering Controls with Music Control Activated in settings.2.- Open your music/video player and start playing a song/video3.- You can now use other apps while listening music, Hovering Controls will remember wich app was playing your song/video, if you want to change the player, just open it and start playing a song/video!Known issues:- HTC ONE not working as it should.- Firefox not suported.- for some users, slide twice is difficult, we are implementing a new shake/tilt system.- Browser and Gallery may not work in all apps.Features:- Set apps to open with all the available gestures.- Silence alarm.- Silence incoming call.- Switch betwen recent apps (like back and forward behaviour)- Fast go to home screen- QuickGlance like Galaxy S4 has!!!- Control your music player (next/previous/pause/resume) even with screen off!!!- Shake phone during a call to activate/deactivate speakerphone.- Answer incoming call, just put your phone near to your ear (its like Hover Hold) - Lock/Unlock screen with hand slides! - Flip Cover Mode.And if you have your phone Rooted...:- Tilt to slide right left (Beta)- AutoShoot camera to take photo.- Slide betwen your photos in your image gallery (1 slide->next, 2 slides->previous)- Scroll up and down in your browser  (1 slide->down, 2 slides->up.

Even if you were to search on a computer, it still would not give you any reward credits.  As an indication of this, no searches will appear, and it will seem as if the application is not doing anything.  Quite the contrary, as in the background it is still running, but not appearing.  You will not get any credit for these searches, and the only search you will physically be able to see is the last search.  This has nothing to do with my application - try again at a later time and most of the time it does work!  Again, this is not because of my application but rather because of the actual website.  And if you don't believe me... when this happens in the application, go on the actual website, and search regularly, and you will not get any reward credits for that either.**All of the information you need can be found in the Information tab within the application itself.Please do not hesitate to shoot me an e-mail with any questions, suggestions, comments, etc.  I would much prefer to receive an e-mail flaming me for a problem directly rather than reading a 1 star review!  I respond pretty quickly to most emails.  My e-mail address can be found at the bottom of this page.**PRO VERSION**Please note, that v2.0 has brought many changes and improvements, including multi-account support.  Please see the information tab within the application itself for full details on how to use this new version.If you choose not to use multi-account, or if it is giving you trouble, please use the 'Single Account' automator - which is the same setup as versions previous to 2.0.In this version, doing an auto search will also automatically search on the mobile site as well, which will satisfy the requirements for earning the extra 10 credits per day via mobile searches.

It uses augmented reality to show on top of your camera a layer of geographical information such as Compass orientation, GPS position and different phone inclinations like a theodolite optical instrument.Android 4 users: if you get a FC on startup, please turn off hardware acceleration from your setting. A fix has been made and is being tested for the next release.What you can do with GeoCam:* GeoPictures: an original way of storing your holiday photo album. See all you pictures on Google Maps or on Google Earth on your personal computer with the export feature. Add markers with your comments on places you liked. You can share these albums with anyone who can run Google Earth, and use the EXIF GPS data stored by GeoCam to view them with any EXIF compatible application.* GeoVideos: the first app to let you record videos with an embed layer of geographical data. A useful addition to pictures - you can see pitch, roll and compass orientation over time on charts.* Bearings: GeoCam is an accurate measure tool. It shows your compass orientation (choose between magnetic or geographic North), your inclination and elevation with readable cursors (like a cockpit HUD). It can be used in terrain mapping, on a glide, sailing, mountain biking...* Measurements: Evaluate the distance to any object with the triangulation feature. You can also measure its height once the distance is known. This is not done by showing any unreadable cursor on the screen, but with mathematical formulas. Choose between metric and imperial measure systems.* GeoCaching: prepare a list of key places in an area and view them with your camera on augmented reality: name, distance. You will not require a data connection so it can be used when hiking abroad, when visiting another city... This will help you make sure you are going in the right direction and give you remaining distance. You can also add markers during your hike with the \"Add here\" option, for example to flag the base camp, a water source, or anything interesting you find on your way.With GeoCam Pro, you get:* No Ads* Record and playback augmented video. This is a powerful tool in addition to geophoto to record the topology of any area for further reference, as you can add your own audio commentary. Augmented video is an exclusivity of GeoCam by Wazar.* Export KMZ files to Google Earth, to display your pictures and markers in their original location and orientation, and share them easily.

It may not work with \"S-ON\" devices and locked bootloaders. This app does not make any permanent changes to your device - a reboot will undo any modification. That's why there is also the option to enable this feature at boot.Note that if you have USB connected when the app activates or deactivates adbd root mode, you may need to unplug/replug the cable or run \"adb kill-server\" on your computer before adb will work again.For discussion and support, see the XDA-Developers.com thread here:http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1687590Note that this download is also available from that thread completely for free.

Super Speed for the Android is the ultimate in smartphone optimization. When you download Super Speed you will transform your smartphone into an actual smart, smartphone. Once you have had your phone for a significant amount of time, you will notice that your smartphone has actually gotten dumber over time. Wondering what happened? Your phone is reaching its limit on memory space. But with Super Speed, your phone will be operating at maximum strength and efficiency. Are you wondering how Super Speed works? Super Speed works by giving your Android a significant boost and managing internal memory storage.When you download Super Speed, the app is installed as a widget and optimizes the following three sections of your smartphone:\u2022 The smartphone\u2019s cache.\u2022 The smartphone\u2019s system settings\u2022 The smartphone\u2019s processes.Each of the three sections is significantly improved to make your smartphone fast! The widget also includes a handy \u201cprocess manager\u201d which will periodically manage unnecessary phone memory. Super Speed works just like the name suggests - fast. With just one click, the widget is ready to go and put to work. The \u201cperformance manager\u201d cuts down on the phone\u2019s cache and memory clutter, which is often the source of speed and performance issues.When your Android smartphone is getting sluggish and not performing the way you need it to then the time has come to download Super Speed. Your smartphone\u2019s internal memory processes will be constantly managed with Super Speed - it does the work that no other app on the market can do. When your phone gets bogged with too much memory that has been snuck in by other apps and downloads, Super Speed will manage the cache so you don\u2019t get stuck with junk in your memory cache trunk!Cached files are temporary files that are created with every app you download, website you visit, and internet use. Cache buildup creeps on users when you aren\u2019t even suspecting it. You are enjoying your smartphone, loading it up with all the apps that you need and the next thing you know, you have no memory or space! Once internal memory space begins to grow, your phone will then become slow, sluggish, and less effective!

Horizontal swipes will make the camera orbit, and vertical swipes will control camera elevation. Use pinch to zoom in and out. To focus the camera on a specific block, tap and hold the block to select it.BUILDINGTo build up your world, you first select the block you want to add in the library strip at the bottom of the screen. Then you simply need to tap on one of the 6 faces of an existing block that is already in the world. The new block will be attached to the selected face. Once a new block is placed, it will automatically be selected, and you can delete it by tapping the DELETE icon. To select another block, simply tap and hold it.ORIENTATIONYou can change the orientation of a selected block by swiping on the TURN icon. You can turn it on the vertical axis by swiping horizontally, or turn it on the horizontal axis by swiping vertically. If none of the blocks are selected, you can predetermine the orientation of the next new block.DYNAMIC OBJECTSAt the tail end of the block library, there is a special set of objects that are marked with a red dot in circle. These objects are dynamic objects, which means that they can be moved in the game. If you place these blocks in your world, they will function as so called spawn-points for the object. You cannot change the orientation of dynamic objects spawn points. You must put one, and only one vehicle in your world. Currently, the world editor does not support multiple vehicles in a single level. Also, there is a limit on the number of blocks you can use to build your world, which is currently set at 1024 blocks.GAME OBJECTIVESThe are several ways in which you can set the win-conditions for your level. You can place a black and white chequered floor: if the vehicle parks on top of it, the level is won. You can place unloading spots (marked with a red cross) in the level, along with crates. If all the crates in the level are placed in the unloading zones, the level is won. Lastly, you can place a soccerball and a basket in the level.

If you want to test the functionality before you buy, try it out for a few days and see!Please note: this is a plug-in. You MUST have either Locale or Tasker installed for this to work. It is built as a plug-in for either of these, and will never function on its own. If you don't understand what Locale or Tasker are, then please do not install this plug-in.When you use Bluetooth Detection within Tasker or Locale, you can create a profile that lets you act upon Bluetooth connections or nearby devices. For example, you can use Locale to start playing music when a connection is made to your car's Bluetooth audio profile, or enable work mode when near your work laptop.Tasker users might ask, \"So what makes this different from the native functionality in Tasker?\" The answer is mainly \"ease of use\" - not everyone wants to type in a MAC ID :).  But there are also some features that I think are unique. Some examples: you can select class of device, so that (for instance) any A2DP connection triggers a task, or you can specify that you only care about a connection to your car's BT when it's the Hands-Free profile.  You can also set a delay on unsetting the condition, and all of this is done in a very user-friendly interface.  And you also get a local Tasker Variable with the name of the last connected device.Note for Tasker Users: Once installed, you can find Bluetooth Detection by going to Profiles, and adding a \"State\" condition.

GPS latitude longitude altitude speed battery level, IMU data).  Log file can be directly imported to the Dashware Software and Google Earth.It enhances the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ WiFi video connection performance. It will boost the WiFi between range extender and transmitter output signal to increase the FPV range up to 100%.It also enables the encryption between the range extender and your device.It is a must-have app for doing long range FPV (First Personal View).Flight Logger Usage:1. Power on both Phantom 2 Vision+ aircraft and range extender.2. Connect your device to DJI Phantom Vision+ Wi-Fi network.3. Open Vision+ Utility app, slide the Enable Logger switch to turn on the logger.4. Open DJI Offical Vision app, and go to CAMERA mode.5. After each flight, switch off the logger and flight details will be recorded to your device local VisionPlusUtility directory.How it works:After you enable logger, there is a preinstalled separate server program running on your phantom to monitor the serial port that is used by the DJI official app. This server side program sends the flight info to our app and then our app records the info to a log file. It does not change any phantom related config files and there is no impact on your phantom and the DJI official app operation. Booster Usage: 1. Power on both Phantom 2 Vision+ aircraft and range extender.2. Connect your device to DJI Phantom Vision+ Wi-Fi network.3. Open Vision+ Utility app, slide the Connect Vision switch to connect the apps to DJI Phantom Vision+ via the Wi-Fi network.4. After the connection is established, select the camera transmit power (15-17 dBm is recommended) to boost up the Wi-Fi.Encryption Usage:1. Click Security to enble the encryption.2. Enter the encryption password and click the renew button to reboot the range extender.3.After the range extender reboots, using the encryption password you entered to re-connect to your newly encrypted range extender.How it works:The encryption is done by the openwrt official UCI System.  The wifi configuration file is surely RESTORABLE by resetting the range extender.  After you reset and restart the Range Extender. You will need to bind it with the Phantom 2 Vision+ again to recreate its Wi-Fi network.   WARNING:  This App is only compatible with DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

Includes all standard features of an audio hardware baby monitor and some surprising extras.Works at any distance. Dormi can use any available route to connect parent and child units (WiFi, mobile data - Edge, 3G, 4G, HSPA+, LTE), and can work even when Internet is not available (WiFi Direct, HotSpot / AP)Ultimate feature? You can connect MULTIPLE devices in parent mode to a single child device simultaneously.Intelligent audioYou don't need to configure microphone sensitivity - Dormi adjusts to noise levels automatically. Leave the device several meters away from the sleeping baby and it will still be able to detect when it cries and amplify the sound for the parent device as if it were placed right next to the baby.Press and hold the Listen button to hear sound from the child device even while the baby is not crying. Equally, use the Talk button to talk back to soothe or calm the baby while you are on your way.Convenient info-centerWith Dormi you always know what's going on. All important information about the child device is always available while monitoring. If connection with the child device is lost, the parent device will notify you.Dormi will even notify you about missed calls and new text messages received on the child device, so you will not miss something important while not having direct access to the device.We know Android!If the baby starts crying while you are on the phone, you will be notified with vibrations and a gentle beep to your ear - without abruptly disturbing the phone call, yet letting you know.Of course, Dormi works in the background, even when the device screen is off. Great care has been taken to limit battery usage - you can monitor for many hours on one charge.Have you got an old Android device sitting in the drawer that you have no use for? Not anymore - try using it as the child device with Dormi. We have made the effort to ensure it runs from Android 2.3 onward.Start right away...All you have to do after install is pair two devices together (our autodiscovery feature makes this a breeze) and start monitoring right away.Although unlimited monitoring is paid, you will get 4 hours of monitoring for free every month.If you do decide to make a purchase, you only have to do so on one of the devices participating in the monitoring.

PopU aggregates all Instagram users with this common interest, people can genuinely show likes for each other's photos. You can also promote yourself for other users to follow!How does it work? Firstly, login your Instagram account, then: - You like others' photos or follow others, the effort are rewarded with credits - Choose your own photos for others to like, or promote yourself for others to follow - Tens of thousands of likes and followers can be got here, it's fast and reliable!We don't use robots. All are REAL Instagram people! The more Instagram photos you like, the more likes you can get! It's that easy!Note: Make sure your account is not private when using this app! We cannot deliver likes or followers if your account is private! You can change it by going to: Instagram -> Go to your profile -> Tap \"Edit Your Profile\" -> Turn off \"Posts are Private\"Q: Why I cannot receive credits after completing offers in SponsorPay or Tapjoy?A: It takes around 1-2 hours for an offer to be rewarded. So just wait for a while. And you'd make sure you opened the downloaded apps / games when your network is in good condition, just re-launch the apps / games again! Q: Does PopU use or store my user name and password?A: Your user name and password are passed safely to Instagram for authentication. We don't use or store it anywhere.Q: Why don't PopU offer Auto Liker feature?A: We want all likes to be genuine. We never like or follow without your consent. And technically, Auto Liker feature requires you give out your user name and password, that's something we don't do.Q: How do PopU differentiate from other apps (Gramliker, instlike, likefol, instaliker, wow likes, instalikers , instlikes, likeboost , instagram liker, 1000 likes, Wowlikes , Followers +, Instafollow, 1000Likes, likey , or like4like, PopU, LikeRise)? A: Aside from not using hack ways, PopU is deliberately designed to be fast and fluent in UX.
